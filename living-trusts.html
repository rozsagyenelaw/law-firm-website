Unlike a <a href="wills.html"style="color:#c9a961;text-decoration:none">will</a>, a living trust allows your estate to bypass the costly and time-consuming <a href="probate.html"style="color:#c9a961;text-decoration:none">California probate process</a> entirely.<p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:20px;font-size:17px">With a living trust, you maintain complete control over your assets while you're alive and competent. You serve as the trustee (the person who manages the trust), meaning you can buy, sell, gift, or manage trust assets exactly as you did before. The key difference is legal ownership—your assets are now owned by the trust, not by you personally.<p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:30px;font-size:17px">When you pass away or become incapacitated, your designated successor trustee (usually a family member or professional) steps in to manage or distribute your assets according to your instructions. This happens immediately, without court involvement, saving your family thousands of dollars and many months of <a href="probate.html"style="color:#c9a961;text-decoration:none">probate proceedings</a>. Your successor trustee will handle <a href="trust-administration.html"style="color:#c9a961;text-decoration:none">trust administration</a> following your passing.<h2 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif;font-size:38px;color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:25px;margin-top:50px">How Living Trusts Work in California</h2><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:20px;font-size:17px">California living trusts follow a simple three-party structure:<div style="background:#f8f9fa;padding:30px;border-radius:10px;margin-bottom:30px"><h3 style="color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:15px;font-size:22px"><strong>1. The Grantor (Trustmaker)</strong></h3><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:20px">This is you—the person creating the trust. You decide which assets go into the trust, who will inherit them, and under what conditions. In California, married couples typically create a joint trust together, while single individuals create an individual trust.<h3 style="color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:15px;font-size:22px"><strong>2. The Trustee</strong></h3><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:20px">Initially, you serve as your own trustee, giving you complete control. You name a successor trustee (such as your adult child, sibling, or professional trustee) who takes over if you become incapacitated or when you pass away. This person manages and distributes your assets according to the trust instructions.<h3 style="color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:15px;font-size:22px"><strong>3. The Beneficiaries</strong></h3><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.7">These are the people or organizations you choose to inherit your assets. You can name primary beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries, and set specific conditions for inheritance (such as age requirements for minor children).</div><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:30px;font-size:17px">The trust holds legal title to your assets while you retain beneficial ownership and full control. When you die, the successor trustee distributes assets to beneficiaries according to your instructions—without probate court involvement.<h2 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif;font-size:38px;color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:25px;margin-top:50px">What Is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Will?</h2><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:20px;font-size:17px">A living trust avoids probate, stays private, and takes effect immediately upon your death—often distributing assets within days. A will requires 6-18 months of probate court, becomes public record, costs $5,000-$50,000+ in fees, and offers no incapacity protection during your lifetime.<div style="overflow-x:auto;margin:30px 0"><table style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;background:#fff;box-shadow:0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.1)"><thead><tr style="background:#1e3a5f;color:#fff"><th style="padding:15px;text-align:left;border:1px solid #dee2e6">Feature<th style="padding:15px;text-align:left;border:1px solid #dee2e6">Living Trust<th style="padding:15px;text-align:left;border:1px solid #dee2e6">Will<tbody><tr style="background:#f8f9fa"><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;font-weight:600">Probate Required?<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;color:#28a745"><strong>No - Avoids probate</strong><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;color:#dc3545">Yes - Must go through probate<tr><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;font-weight:600">Time to Distribute<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6">Days to weeks<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6">6-18 months<tr style="background:#f8f9fa"><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;font-weight:600">Privacy<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;color:#28a745"><strong>Completely private</strong><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;color:#dc3545">Public court record<tr><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;font-weight:600">Incapacity Protection<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;color:#28a745"><strong>Yes - Automatic with <a href="power-of-attorney.html"style="color:#c9a961;text-decoration:none">Power of Attorney</a></strong><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;color:#dc3545">No - <a href="conservatorship.html"style="color:#c9a961;text-decoration:none">Conservatorship</a> needed<tr style="background:#f8f9fa"><td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6;font-weight:600">Cost<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6">$575-$1,900 upfront<td style="padding:15px;border:1px solid #dee2e6">$5,000-$50,000+ probate fees</table></div><h2 style="font-family:'Playfair Display',serif;font-size:38px;color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:25px;margin-top:50px">Types of Living Trusts in California</h2><div style="background:#f8f9fa;padding:30px;border-radius:10px;margin-bottom:20px"><h3 style="color:#1e3a5f;margin-bottom:15px;font-size:24px"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"style="color:#c9a961;margin-right:10px"></i>Revocable Living Trust</h3><p style="color:#6c757d;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:15px">This is the standard living trust that 90% of families use.
