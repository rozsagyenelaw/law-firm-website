            <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: 38px; color: #1e3a5f; margin-bottom: 25px; text-align: center;">What Is a Living Trust in California?</h2>

            <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 17px;">
                A living trust (also called a revocable living trust) is a legal document that places your assets into a trust during your lifetime, then transfers them to designated beneficiaries after your death. Unlike a <a href="wills.html" style="color: #c9a961; text-decoration: none;">will</a>, a living trust allows your estate to bypass the costly and time-consuming <a href="probate.html" style="color: #c9a961; text-decoration: none;">California probate process</a> entirely.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 17px;">
                With a living trust, you maintain complete control over your assets while you're alive and competent. You serve as the trustee (the person who manages the trust), meaning you can buy, sell, gift, or manage trust assets exactly as you did before. The key difference is legal ownership—your assets are now owned by the trust, not by you personally.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 17px;">
                When you pass away or become incapacitated, your designated successor trustee (usually a family member or professional) steps in to manage or distribute your assets according to your instructions. This happens immediately, without court involvement, saving your family thousands of dollars and many months of <a href="probate.html" style="color: #c9a961; text-decoration: none;">probate proceedings</a>. Your successor trustee will handle <a href="trust-administration.html" style="color: #c9a961; text-decoration: none;">trust administration</a> following your passing.
            </p>

            <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: 38px; color: #1e3a5f; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 50px;">How Living Trusts Work in California</h2>

            <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 17px;">
                California living trusts follow a simple three-party structure:
            </p>

            <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <h3 style="color: #1e3a5f; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 22px;"><strong>1. The Grantor (Trustmaker)</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    This is you—the person creating the trust. You decide which assets go into the trust, who will inherit them, and under what conditions. In California, married couples typically create a joint trust together, while single individuals create an individual trust.
                </p>

                <h3 style="color: #1e3a5f; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 22px;"><strong>2. The Trustee</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    Initially, you serve as your own trustee, giving you complete control. You name a successor trustee (such as your adult child, sibling, or professional trustee) who takes over if you become incapacitated or when you pass away. This person manages and distributes your assets according to the trust instructions.
                </p>

                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7;">
                    These are the people or organizations you choose to inherit your assets. You can name primary beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries, and set specific conditions for inheritance (such as age requirements for minor children).
                </p>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px; font-size: 17px;">
                The trust holds legal title to your assets while you retain beneficial ownership and full control. When you die, the successor trustee distributes assets to beneficiaries according to your instructions—without probate court involvement.

            <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 17px;">
                A living trust avoids probate, stays private, and takes effect immediately upon your death—often distributing assets within days. A will requires 6-18 months of probate court, becomes public record, costs $5,000-$50,000+ in fees, and offers no incapacity protection during your lifetime.

                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    This is the standard living trust that 90% of families use. You can revoke (cancel) or amend the trust anytime during your lifetime. You maintain complete control, can add or remove assets, change beneficiaries, or even dissolve the trust entirely.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7;">
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Most California families who want probate avoidance, incapacity protection, and flexibility.

                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    Once established, this trust cannot be easily modified or revoked. You give up control in exchange for significant asset protection and tax benefits. Irrevocable trusts protect assets from lawsuits, creditors, and estate taxes.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7;">

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7;">California real estate automatically triggers probate. A $500,000 home could cost your family $15,000-$26,000 in probate fees—easily avoided with a trust.</p>

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7;">California's probate threshold is $184,500 (as of 2024). Above this amount, full probate is required. Most homeowners exceed this threshold easily.</p>

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7;">Trusts let you control when and how children receive inheritance (age milestones, education requirements), protecting them from receiving large sums too young.</p>

                        <p style="color: #6c757d; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">No. As the trustee of your own living trust, you retain complete control. You can buy, sell, gift, or manage trust assets exactly as you did before.</p>
