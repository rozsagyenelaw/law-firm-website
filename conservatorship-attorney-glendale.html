In Glendale and throughout California, conservatorships are necessary when an adult lacks the capacity to make informed decisions due to dementia, Alzheimer's disease, developmental disabilities, mental illness, or severe physical incapacity. The conservator has legal authority to make financial and/or personal care decisions on behalf of the conservatee."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "California law recognizes two types of conservatorships. A conservator of the person makes decisions about the conservatee's daily life, including where they live, medical care, food, clothing, and personal care. A conservator of the estate manages the conservatee's financial affairs, including paying bills, managing assets, filing taxes, and protecting property. Many Glendale conservatorships involve appointing the same person as conservator of both the person and the estate, giving them authority over all aspects of the conservatee's life and finances."

However, if the conservatee contests the conservatorship or if there are disputes among family members, the process can take 6 months to a year or longer. For urgent situations where immediate action is needed to protect the proposed conservatee, our Glendale conservatorship lawyer can file for a temporary conservatorship, which can be granted within days. The court investigator must interview the proposed conservatee, review the situation, and file a report with the court before the hearing."

Contested conservatorships can cost $10,000 to $50,000 or more if family members dispute the need for conservatorship or who should serve as conservator. Ongoing annual costs include court supervision fees and accounting preparation. Many conservatorship costs can be paid from the conservatee's assets if they have sufficient funds. Our Glendale conservatorship attorney provides transparent fee quotes during your free consultation."

LPS conservatorships are typically initiated by county mental health departments rather than family members and require evidence of grave disability due to mental illness. Unlike general conservatorships, LPS conservatorships are initially established for one year and must be renewed annually. Our Glendale conservatorship lawyer can help families navigate LPS conservatorship proceedings when a loved one suffers from severe psychiatric illness."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "While California law does not require you to hire an attorney for conservatorship proceedings, it is strongly recommended. Conservatorship law is complex, with strict procedural requirements, court investigations, and potential challenges from family members or the proposed conservatee. Mistakes in the petition or process can result in denial, delays, or personal liability. An experienced Glendale conservatorship attorney ensures all legal requirements are met, represents you at the court hearing, and protects both you and your loved one throughout the process. The court will also appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee's interests."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, most conservatorships can be avoided with proper advance planning. A comprehensive estate plan including a durable power of attorney for finances and an advance healthcare directive allows trusted family members to manage your affairs if you become incapacitated, without court involvement. A living trust also helps avoid conservatorship of the estate by allowing your successor trustee to manage trust assets. Our Glendale office provides complete estate planning services to help you avoid the need for conservatorship in the future. However, if your loved one is already incapacitated and did not complete these documents while competent, conservatorship may be the only option."

            <h2>What Is a Conservatorship in California?</h2>
            <p>A conservatorship is a court proceeding in which a judge appoints a responsible person or organization (called a conservator) to care for another adult (called a conservatee) who cannot properly provide for their personal needs or manage their own financial affairs. Conservatorships are governed by California Probate Code and require court supervision to protect the conservatee's rights.</p>

            <h3>When Is a Conservatorship Necessary?</h3>
            <p>As a Glendale conservatorship lawyer, I help families determine when conservatorship is appropriate. Common situations include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dementia or Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> When cognitive decline prevents someone from making safe decisions about their care or finances</li>
                <li><strong>Severe Mental Illness:</strong> When psychiatric conditions render someone unable to care for basic needs</li>
                <li><strong>Developmental Disabilities:</strong> When adults with autism, Down syndrome, or other disabilities need ongoing assistance</li>
                <li><strong>Traumatic Brain Injury:</strong> When accident or injury causes permanent cognitive impairment</li>
                <li><strong>Stroke or Neurological Conditions:</strong> When medical conditions affect decision-making capacity</li>
                <li><strong>Substance Abuse:</strong> When addiction prevents someone from functioning independently</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Conservatorships are typically considered a last resort when less restrictive alternatives like powers of attorney or supported decision-making are insufficient or were not established before incapacity occurred.</p>

            <h3>Conservator of the Person vs. Conservator of the Estate</h3>
            <p>California recognizes two distinct types of conservatorships, and our Glendale conservatorship attorney can help you understand which is needed for your situation:</p>

            <p><strong>Conservator of the Person:</strong> Has legal authority to make decisions about the conservatee's daily care and personal needs, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where the conservatee will live (home, assisted living, memory care facility)</li>
                <li>Medical treatment and healthcare decisions</li>
                <li>Food, clothing, and personal care</li>
                <li>Social activities and recreation</li>
                <li>Consent to or refusal of medical procedures</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Conservator of the Estate:</strong> Has legal authority to manage the conservatee's financial affairs and property, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paying bills and managing bank accounts</li>
                <li>Managing investments and assets</li>
                <li>Collecting income (Social Security, pensions, rents)</li>
                <li>Filing tax returns</li>
                <li>Protecting and maintaining property</li>
                <li>Selling real estate or other assets when necessary</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Many conservatorships appoint the same person as conservator of both the person and the estate, giving comprehensive authority over all aspects of the conservatee's life and finances.</p>

            <h2>Types of Conservatorships in Glendale</h2>

            <h3>General Conservatorship (Probate Conservatorship)</h3>
            <p>This is the most common type of conservatorship for adults who cannot care for themselves due to physical or mental limitations. General conservatorships are typically established for elderly individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Our Glendale conservatorship lawyer handles all aspects of general conservatorships from petition filing through ongoing court supervision.</p>

            <h3>Limited Conservatorship</h3>
            <p>Limited conservatorships are designed for adults with developmental disabilities who need some assistance but retain capacity in certain areas. The conservator's powers are limited to only those areas where the conservatee truly needs help, preserving as much independence as possible. Our conservatorship attorney Glendale works extensively with Regional Centers and families of adults with disabilities.</p>

            <h3>LPS Conservatorship (Lanterman-Petris-Short)</h3>
            <p>LPS conservatorships are established for adults with serious mental health disorders who are "gravely disabled" and cannot provide for their basic needs of food, clothing, or shelter due to mental illness. These conservatorships are typically initiated by Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health rather than family members and require specific evidence of grave disability. Our Glendale conservatorship attorney has extensive experience with LPS proceedings and mental health conservatorships.</p>

            <h3>Temporary Conservatorship</h3>
            <p>When immediate action is needed to protect someone from harm or financial abuse, our conservatorship lawyer Glendale CA can petition for a temporary conservatorship. Temporary conservatorships can be granted quickly (often within days) to address emergency situations while the permanent conservatorship petition proceeds through normal channels.</p>

            <h2>The Conservatorship Process in Glendale</h2>
            <p>Establishing a conservatorship in Glendale requires following specific legal procedures mandated by California Probate Code. As your Glendale conservatorship lawyer, I guide you through each step:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Initial Consultation and Case Evaluation</h3>
            <p>We begin with a free consultation to discuss your loved one's situation, evaluate whether conservatorship is appropriate, and explain alternatives if available. We'll review medical records, assess the proposed conservatee's capacity, and determine which type of conservatorship is needed.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Filing the Conservatorship Petition</h3>
            <p>Our conservatorship attorney Glendale prepares and files a comprehensive petition with the Los Angeles County Superior Court at the Glendale Courthouse (600 E Broadway, Glendale, CA 91206). The petition includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed information about the proposed conservatee and their incapacity</li>
                <li>Medical declarations documenting the need for conservatorship</li>
                <li>Information about the proposed conservator and their qualifications</li>
                <li>Details about the conservatee's estate and assets</li>
                <li>Request for specific powers (person and/or estate)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Notice to Interested Parties</h3>
            <p>California law requires notice of the conservatorship proceeding to the proposed conservatee and their close relatives. Our Glendale conservatorship attorney ensures proper notice is given to all required parties, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The proposed conservatee (in person)</li>
                <li>Spouse or domestic partner</li>
                <li>Children, parents, and siblings</li>
                <li>Anyone nominated as conservator in the proposed conservatee's estate planning documents</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Court Investigation</h3>
            <p>The court appoints an investigator who interviews the proposed conservatee, reviews the circumstances, inspects living arrangements, and files a report with the court. The investigator acts as the court's eyes and ears to ensure the conservatorship is necessary and appropriate. Our conservatorship lawyer Glendale CA works cooperatively with court investigators to facilitate this process.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Legal Representation for Proposed Conservatee</h3>
            <p>The court appoints an attorney (called Probate Volunteer Panel counsel) to represent the proposed conservatee's interests. This attorney may conduct their own investigation and will represent the proposed conservatee at the hearing.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Conservatorship Hearing</h3>
            <p>At the court hearing before a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, our Glendale conservatorship lawyer presents evidence supporting the need for conservatorship. If the proposed conservatee or any family member contests the conservatorship, the court will hold an evidentiary trial. For uncontested cases, the hearing is typically straightforward, and the judge issues Letters of Conservatorship granting legal authority.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Ongoing Duties and Court Supervision</h3>
            <p>After appointment, the conservator has ongoing responsibilities including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Filing an initial inventory of the conservatee's assets (within 90 days)</li>
                <li>Preparing annual accountings of financial transactions</li>
                <li>Filing status reports about the conservatee's condition</li>
                <li>Obtaining court approval for major decisions (selling real estate, etc.)</li>
                <li>Attending periodic court review hearings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our Glendale conservatorship attorney provides ongoing support to help conservators fulfill their duties and maintain compliance with court requirements.</p>

            <h2>Costs of Establishing a Conservatorship in Glendale</h2>
            <p>As a Glendale conservatorship lawyer, I believe in transparent pricing so families can plan appropriately. Conservatorship costs typically include:</p>

            <h3>Court Filing Fees</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Petition filing fee: $465</li>
                <li>Court investigator fee: $400-$600</li>
                <li>Probate notes and records: $50-$100</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Attorney Fees</h3>
            <p>Our conservatorship attorney Glendale provides legal services at hourly rates or flat fees depending on case complexity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uncontested conservatorship:</strong> $3,000-$5,000 (includes petition preparation, court appearances, and obtaining Letters of Conservatorship)</li>
                <li><strong>Contested conservatorship:</strong> $10,000-$50,000+ depending on litigation complexity</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary conservatorship:</strong> $2,500-$4,000</li>
                <li><strong>Limited conservatorship:</strong> $3,500-$6,000</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ongoing Costs</h3>
            <p>After establishment, ongoing costs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Annual accounting preparation: $1,000-$2,500</li>
                <li>Court supervision fees: $450/year</li>
                <li>Attorney fees for court approval of major transactions</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Many conservatorship costs can be paid from the conservatee's assets if they have sufficient funds. Our Glendale conservatorship attorney can petition the court to approve payment of reasonable attorney fees and costs from the conservatee's estate. We also offer payment plans for families who need financial flexibility.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Alternatives to Conservatorship</h2>
            <p>As a responsible Glendale conservatorship lawyer, I always explore whether less restrictive alternatives might meet your needs. Conservatorships should be a last resort because they significantly restrict personal freedom. Consider these alternatives:</p>

            <h3>Durable Power of Attorney for Finances</h3>
            <p>If the individual has capacity now but wants to plan ahead, a durable power of attorney allows them to name someone to manage finances if they become incapacitated. This avoids the need for conservatorship of the estate.</p>

            <h3>Advance Healthcare Directive</h3>
            <p>An advance healthcare directive appoints someone to make medical decisions if the person becomes unable to do so, avoiding the need for conservatorship of the person.</p>

            <h3>Revocable Living Trust</h3>
            <p>Assets held in a living trust are managed by a successor trustee if the settlor becomes incapacitated, providing an alternative to conservatorship of the estate for trust assets.</p>

            <h3>Supported Decision-Making Agreements</h3>
            <p>For individuals with developmental disabilities, supported decision-making allows them to retain legal capacity while receiving help from supporters in making decisions.</p>

            <h3>Representative Payee (Social Security)</h3>
            <p>For individuals who only receive Social Security or SSI benefits, appointing a representative payee through the Social Security Administration may be sufficient without conservatorship.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, if your loved one is already incapacitated and did not execute these documents while competent, conservatorship may be the only legal option. Our Glendale conservatorship attorney can help you evaluate your specific situation during a free consultation.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is a conservatorship in California?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">A conservatorship is a court proceeding where a judge appoints a responsible person (the conservator) to care for another adult (the conservatee) who cannot properly care for themselves or manage their own finances. In Glendale and throughout California, conservatorships are necessary when an adult lacks the capacity to make informed decisions due to dementia, Alzheimer's disease, developmental disabilities, mental illness, or severe physical incapacity. The conservator has legal authority to make financial and/or personal care decisions on behalf of the conservatee.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between a conservator of the person and conservator of the estate?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">California law recognizes two types of conservatorships. A conservator of the person makes decisions about the conservatee's daily life, including where they live, medical care, food, clothing, and personal care. A conservator of the estate manages the conservatee's financial affairs, including paying bills, managing assets, filing taxes, and protecting property. Many Glendale conservatorships involve appointing the same person as conservator of both the person and the estate, giving them authority over all aspects of the conservatee's life and finances.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long does it take to establish a conservatorship in Glendale?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">In Glendale and Los Angeles County, establishing a conservatorship typically takes 60 to 90 days from filing the petition to the court hearing. However, if the conservatee contests the conservatorship or if there are disputes among family members, the process can take 6 months to a year or longer. For urgent situations where immediate action is needed to protect the proposed conservatee, our Glendale conservatorship lawyer can file for a temporary conservatorship, which can be granted within days. The court investigator must interview the proposed conservatee, review the situation, and file a report with the court before the hearing.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How much does a conservatorship cost in California?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">The cost of establishing a conservatorship in Glendale typically ranges from $3,000 to $6,000 for uncontested cases, including attorney fees, court filing fees ($465), court investigator fees ($400-$600), and other costs. Contested conservatorships can cost $10,000 to $50,000 or more if family members dispute the need for conservatorship or who should serve as conservator. Ongoing annual costs include court supervision fees and accounting preparation. Many conservatorship costs can be paid from the conservatee's assets if they have sufficient funds. Our Glendale conservatorship attorney provides transparent fee quotes during your free consultation.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is an LPS conservatorship?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">An LPS conservatorship (Lanterman-Petris-Short) is a special type of conservatorship for adults with serious mental health disorders who are gravely disabled and cannot provide for their basic needs of food, clothing, or shelter. LPS conservatorships are typically initiated by county mental health departments rather than family members and require evidence of grave disability due to mental illness. Unlike general conservatorships, LPS conservatorships are initially established for one year and must be renewed annually. Our Glendale conservatorship lawyer can help families navigate LPS conservatorship proceedings when a loved one suffers from severe psychiatric illness.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do I need a lawyer for a conservatorship in Glendale?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">While California law does not require you to hire an attorney for conservatorship proceedings, it is strongly recommended. Conservatorship law is complex, with strict procedural requirements, court investigations, and potential challenges from family members or the proposed conservatee. Mistakes in the petition or process can result in denial, delays, or personal liability. An experienced Glendale conservatorship attorney ensures all legal requirements are met, represents you at the court hearing, and protects both you and your loved one throughout the process. The court will also appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee's interests.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Can a conservatorship be avoided with proper estate planning?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes, most conservatorships can be avoided with proper advance planning. A comprehensive estate plan including a durable power of attorney for finances and an advance healthcare directive allows trusted family members to manage your affairs if you become incapacitated, without court involvement. A living trust also helps avoid conservatorship of the estate by allowing your successor trustee to manage trust assets. Our Glendale office provides complete estate planning services to help you avoid the need for conservatorship in the future. However, if your loved one is already incapacitated and did not complete these documents while competent, conservatorship may be the only option.</div>
