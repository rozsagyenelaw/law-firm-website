                <p>Settling a trust in Woodland Hills (91364/91367) requires strict adherence to 2025 California probate mandates: serving the <strong>16061.7 Statutory Notice</strong> within 60 days of death and obtaining a "Step-up in Basis" appraisal for properties in <strong>Walnut Acres</strong> or <strong>Carlton Terrace</strong>. Because median home values now exceed $1,300,000, successor trustees must file intergenerational exclusions with the LA County Assessor within one year to protect the <strong>Proposition 19</strong> tax base. All formal court filings for Woodland Hills residents are centralized at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Warner Center Business Succession & High-Value Assets</h2>
                    <p>Woodland Hills is the economic engine of the San Fernando Valley. Many successor trustees here are managing not just a family home, but also <strong>Warner Center business interests, commercial real estate along Ventura Blvd, and sophisticated investment portfolios</strong>. The fiduciary standard is high; as a trustee, you are responsible for maintaining business continuity and protecting assets from the "frozen" state that occurs without professional legal guidance.</p>

                    <p>As your <strong>Woodland Hills trust settlement lawyer</strong>, we provide the <strong>Trustee Accounting</strong> required to satisfy beneficiaries and prevent claims of mismanagement. In high-equity enclaves like <strong>Vista de la Montana</strong>, providing a transparent, attorney-reviewed accounting is your best defense against "surcharges"—where a trustee is forced to pay for errors out of their own pocket.</p>

                    <h2>Stanley Mosk Courthouse: Centralized Hub for West Valley Filings</h2>
                    <p>Following current 2025 court rules, all Woodland Hills probate and trust administration petitions are centralized at the <strong><a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a> (111 N. Hill St, Los Angeles)</strong>. Whether you need to file a <a href="/probate"><strong>Heggstad Petition</strong></a> to move a "forgotten" asset back into the trust or require court instructions on a complex business transition, our firm manages the entire downtown filing process and all courtroom appearances.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 19: Protecting the Woodland Hills Family Home</h2>
                    <p>In 2025, <strong>Proposition 19</strong> is the single largest property tax threat for West Valley heirs. If a child inherits a parent's primary residence in <strong>Woodland West</strong> or <strong>Corbin Palms</strong> and fails to move in and file for the exclusion within one year, the tax base will be reassessed to market value. For many local families, this can mean a tax hike from $3,000 to over $18,000 per year. We coordinate with the <strong>LA County Assessor</strong> to ensure all "Family Home Protection" filings are submitted accurately and on time.</p>

                    <h2>Protecting Yourself from Fiduciary Surcharges</h2>
                    <p>Successor trustees in Woodland Hills are often family members who do not realize they can be held <strong>personally liable</strong> for mistakes. If you distribute assets too early, miss a creditor window, or fail to follow the Prudent Investor Rule, beneficiaries can petition the court to surcharge you. Our firm acts as your legal shield, documenting every fiduciary step of the <a href="/trust-administration">trust administration process</a> to ensure your personal assets are never at risk.</p>
