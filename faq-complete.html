                <h2>Living Trust Basics (15 Questions)</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a living trust in California?</h3>
                    <p>A living trust is a legal document that holds your assets during your lifetime and transfers them to your beneficiaries when you die — without going through probate court. In California, a properly funded living trust avoids the expensive probate process, which costs 4-7% of your estate value and takes 12-18 months. The trust is "revocable," meaning you can change or cancel it anytime. You remain in full control of your assets as the trustee, and when you pass away or become incapacitated, your chosen successor trustee takes over management and distribution.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need a living trust in California?</h3>
                    <p>If you own real estate in California or have assets exceeding $184,500, you almost certainly need a living trust. Without one, your estate must go through California probate, which costs approximately $46,000 for a $1 million estate and takes 12-18 months. For a typical California home worth $800,000-$1.5 million, probate fees range from $36,000-$56,000+. A living trust avoids probate entirely, saving your family tens of thousands of dollars and over a year of court proceedings. The Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene offers living trusts starting at $575.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the difference between a will and a living trust?</h3>
                    <p>A will goes through probate court after you die (12-18 months, 4-7% in fees, public record). A living trust avoids probate entirely — assets transfer privately to beneficiaries within weeks, with no court involvement. Both documents name beneficiaries, but only a living trust avoids California's expensive probate process. For California homeowners, a living trust typically saves $30,000-$60,000+ in probate costs while keeping your estate completely private.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the difference between a revocable and irrevocable trust?</h3>
                    <p>A revocable living trust can be changed, amended, or canceled at any time during your lifetime — you maintain full control. An irrevocable trust cannot be changed once created and removes assets from your estate permanently. Most California families use revocable trusts for basic estate planning. Irrevocable trusts are used for specific purposes like asset protection, Medicaid planning, or estate tax reduction for estates exceeding $13.61 million.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I be my own trustee?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Most people serve as their own trustee (or co-trustees for married couples) and maintain complete control over their assets. You can buy, sell, refinance, and manage property exactly as before — the only difference is that title is held in the trust's name. When you die or become incapacitated, your named successor trustee takes over, avoiding the need for court-appointed conservators or the probate process.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What assets should be in my living trust?</h3>
                    <p>Your living trust should hold: real estate (your home and any investment properties), bank accounts, brokerage accounts, business interests, vehicles (in some cases), and valuable personal property. Assets that should NOT go in your trust include: retirement accounts (401k, IRA), life insurance policies (name beneficiaries directly), and health savings accounts. Proper trust funding is critical — an unfunded trust doesn't avoid probate. We help clients transfer all appropriate assets after signing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is trust funding and why is it important?</h3>
                    <p>Trust funding is the process of transferring your assets into your living trust's name. This is the most critical step in estate planning — an unfunded trust is useless and your estate will still go through probate. Funding includes: recording a new deed for your home, retitling bank accounts, updating brokerage account ownership, and assigning business interests. Many attorneys create trusts but don't help with funding; we include comprehensive funding guidance with every living trust package.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to create a living trust?</h3>
                    <p>Creating a living trust typically takes 2-4 weeks from initial consultation to signing. The process includes: consultation to understand your goals (1 meeting), document drafting (3-7 days), client review period, signing appointment with notarization, and trust funding assistance. For clients with urgent needs, expedited service is available. The Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene offers flexible scheduling including video consultations and mobile notary services.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I create a living trust online?</h3>
                    <p>While online services exist, they carry significant risks. Generic templates often fail to address California-specific requirements, complex family situations, or proper funding procedures. Many online trusts are never properly funded, rendering them useless. An improperly drafted trust can fail to avoid probate or create unintended tax consequences. For a document this important, working with an experienced California attorney ensures your trust actually works. Our attorney-prepared trusts start at just $575 — comparable to online services but with personalized legal guidance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to update my living trust?</h3>
                    <p>You should review your living trust every 3-5 years or after major life events including: marriage or divorce, birth or death of beneficiaries, significant asset changes (buying/selling property), moving to a new state, changes in tax laws, or if your chosen trustees/agents can no longer serve.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens to my living trust when I die?</h3>
                    <p>When you die, your successor trustee takes over immediately — no court involvement required. They will: notify beneficiaries, gather trust assets, pay final debts and taxes, file your final tax return, and distribute assets according to your trust instructions. This process typically takes 3-6 months, compared to 12-18 months for probate. Your estate remains completely private, and beneficiaries receive their inheritance much faster than through probate.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can a living trust be contested?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, but it's more difficult than contesting a will. Trust contests must be filed within 120 days of receiving notice of the trust and require grounds such as: lack of mental capacity, undue influence, fraud, or improper execution. Because trusts don't go through probate court, there's less opportunity for disgruntled family members to contest. Proper drafting and execution with an experienced attorney reduces contest risk significantly.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does a living trust protect assets from creditors?</h3>
                    <p>A standard revocable living trust does NOT protect assets from your creditors during your lifetime — you still own and control the assets. However, certain irrevocable trusts can provide creditor protection. For asset protection planning, specialized trusts like Domestic Asset Protection Trusts (DAPTs), Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs), or offshore trusts may be appropriate. The Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene can evaluate your situation and recommend appropriate strategies.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does a living trust avoid estate taxes?</h3>
                    <p>A standard revocable living trust does not reduce estate taxes — assets remain part of your taxable estate. However, for married couples with combined estates exceeding $13.61 million (2024 federal exemption), A-B trust provisions can maximize both spouses' exemptions. California has no state estate tax. For high-net-worth clients, advanced planning strategies including irrevocable trusts, charitable trusts, and gifting strategies can reduce estate tax exposure.</p>

                    <p>Living trust costs vary based on: attorney experience, document complexity, included services, and geographic location.

Key factors affecting value: Does the attorney personally meet with you? Are documents customized to your situation? Is trust funding assistance included?

                    <h3>Is a living trust worth the cost?</h3>

Beyond cost savings, a living trust provides: privacy (probate is public record), faster distribution to beneficiaries (weeks vs. months), incapacity protection, and control over how and when beneficiaries receive assets. For California homeowners, a living trust is one of the best investments you can make.</p>
