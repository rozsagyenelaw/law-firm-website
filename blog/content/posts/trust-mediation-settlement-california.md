## Trust Mediation in California

### What Is Mediation?

**Process:**
- Neutral third-party mediator
- All parties and attorneys present
- Confidential settlement discussions
- Typically full-day session
- Voluntary (but often court-ordered)

**Mediator's role:**
- Facilitate communication
- Identify common ground
- Reality-test positions
- Shuttle diplomacy between rooms
- Help craft creative solutions

**Not arbitration:** Mediator doesn't decide - parties decide

### When Mediation Occurs

**Typical timing:**
- After discovery completed
- Before trial preparation begins
- 12-18 months into litigation
- Sometimes earlier for simple disputes

**Court may order mediation** in many probate courts

### Choosing a Mediator

**Qualifications:**
- Experienced in trust/estate disputes
- Often retired judges
- Or experienced estate attorneys
- Neutral (no prior relationship with parties)

**Finding mediator:**
- Court may provide list
- Parties agree on mediator
- Private mediation services (JAMS, ADR Services)

**Costs:**
- $3,000-$10,000 for full-day session
- Split among parties
- Much less than continuing litigation

### The Mediation Process

**Pre-mediation:**
- Exchange mediation briefs
- Summarize case for mediator
- Outline settlement position
- Describe strengths and weaknesses

**Opening session:**
- All parties in one room
- Each side presents position
- Often tense and emotional
- Sets stage for negotiations

**Caucus sessions:**
- Parties separate into different rooms
- Mediator shuttles between rooms
- Confidential discussions
- Reality-testing positions
- Exploring settlement options

**Negotiation:**
- Back-and-forth offers
- Mediator conveys positions
- Creative solutions explored
- Compromise positions developed

**Resolution or impasse:**
- Agreement reached → Document settlement
- No agreement → Return to litigation

**Success rate:** 70-80% of trust mediations settle

## Settlement Structures

### Full Settlement

**Complete resolution:**
- All claims resolved
- All parties sign agreement
- Litigation dismissed
- Final and binding

**Example:**
- Contest alleges undue influence
- Settlement: Contestant receives $300,000
- Drops all claims
- Trust administered per remaining terms

### Partial Settlement

**Some issues resolved:**
- Certain claims settled
- Others proceed to trial
- Narrow remaining disputes

**Example:**
- Settle compensation dispute
- Continue litigating trust validity

### Structured Settlements

**Creative solutions:**

**Global family settlement:**
- Modify trust for all beneficiaries
- Everyone compromises
- New agreed terms

**Buyout:**
- Contestant paid lump sum
- Withdraws from trust
- Other beneficiaries continue

**Reformed trust:**
- Court approves modified trust
- Addresses concerns
- All parties agree to new terms

**Installment payments:**
- Settlement paid over time
- Secured by trust assets
- Interest paid

### Tax Considerations

**Settlement payments:**
- Typically not taxable if return of inheritance
- Legal fees may be taxable
- Consult tax advisor

**Structured carefully** to minimize tax consequences

## Common Settlement Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Capacity Challenge

**Dispute:**
- New trust gives daughter 90%
- Prior trust split 50/50 between two daughters
- Son alleges lack of capacity

**Settlement:**
- Son receives 30% instead of 10%
- Daughter keeps 70% instead of 90%
- Both avoid trial risk

**Rationale:**
- Son avoids risk of losing completely
- Daughter avoids risk of entire trust invalidated

### Scenario 2: Undue Influence

**Dispute:**
- Caregiver receives $500,000 bequest
- Children allege undue influence
- Evidence mixed

**Settlement:**
- Caregiver receives $150,000
- Children receive balance
- No admission of wrongdoing

**Rationale:**
- Caregiver avoids risk of getting nothing
- Children avoid risk caregiver keeps $500,000
- Compromise reflects litigation risk

### Scenario 3: Trust Administration Dispute

**Dispute:**
- Trustee compensation excessive
- Beneficiary challenges $200,000 in fees
- Trustee claims justified

**Settlement:**
- Reduce fees to $125,000
- Trustee provides detailed accounting
- Continue as trustee

**Rationale:**
- Avoids trustee removal litigation
- Beneficiary gets some fee reduction
- Trust administration continues

### Scenario 4: Multiple Beneficiary Dispute

**Dispute:**
- Three siblings, unequal distributions
- Two contest trust
- Complex family dynamics

**Settlement:**
- Modify distributions
- Create new agreed trust
- All sign settlement

**Rationale:**
- Preserves family relationships
- Everyone compromises
- Avoids years of litigation

## Negotiation Strategies

### Assess Your Case Objectively

**Before mediation:**
- Evaluate evidence honestly
- Consider weaknesses
- Assess trial risks
- Calculate best/worst case scenarios

**Reality check:**
- What's likely outcome at trial?
- What are real odds of success?
- Factor in appeal risk

### Determine Settlement Range

**Calculate:**
- **Best case:** Full victory minus costs/time
- **Worst case:** Complete loss plus costs
- **Settlement range:** Between these extremes

**Example:**
- Best case: Win $1M (minus $200K costs/time value) = $800K
- Worst case: Lose everything plus $150K costs = -$150K
- **Settlement range: $200K-$600K acceptable**

### Understand Other Side's Position

**Consider their perspective:**
- What are their risks?
- What do they fear most?
- What creative solutions might work?
- What do they really need (vs. want)?

**Empathy helps settlement:**
- Understanding motivations
- Finding common ground
- Crafting win-win solutions

### Start Reasonably

**Opening position:**
- Not too extreme
- Room to negotiate
- Shows good faith
- Credible

**Don't:**
- Start at best case scenario
- Make insulting offers
- Appear unreasonable

### Make Principled Offers

**Base offers on:**
- Legal merits
- Evidence strength
- Comparable settlements
- Litigation costs avoided

**Not on:**
- Emotions
- Punishment desire
- Unrealistic expectations

### Focus on Interests, Not Positions

**Positional:**
"I want 50% of the estate."

**Interest-based:**
"I need financial security and want to be treated fairly."

**Interest-based negotiation** opens creative solutions

### Use Mediator Effectively

**Leverage mediator to:**
- Reality-test your position
- Deliver tough messages
- Float trial balloons
- Break impasses
- Suggest creative solutions

**Be candid with mediator** in private caucus

### Know Your Walk-Away Point

**Determine in advance:**
- Minimum acceptable settlement
- When to walk away
- What happens if no settlement

**Don't settle below walk-away** just for closure
