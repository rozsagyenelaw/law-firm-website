- Typically full-day session
- Voluntary (but often court-ordered)

**Mediator's role:**
- Facilitate communication
- Identify common ground
- Reality-test positions
- Shuttle diplomacy between rooms
- Help craft creative solutions

**Not arbitration:** Mediator doesn't decide - parties decide

### When Mediation Occurs

**Typical timing:**

- Before trial preparation begins
- 12-18 months into litigation
- Sometimes earlier for simple disputes

**Court may order mediation** in many probate courts

### Choosing a Mediator

- Often retired judges
- Or experienced estate attorneys
- Neutral (no prior relationship with parties)

**Finding mediator:**
- Court may provide list
- Parties agree on mediator
- Private mediation services (JAMS, ADR Services)

**Costs:**
- $3,000-$10,000 for full-day session
- Split among parties
- Much less than continuing litigation

### The Mediation Process

**Pre-mediation:**
- Exchange mediation briefs
- Summarize case for mediator
- Outline settlement position
- Describe strengths and weaknesses

**Opening session:**
- All parties in one room
- Each side presents position
- Often tense and emotional

- Mediator shuttles between rooms
- Confidential discussions
- Reality-testing positions
- Exploring settlement options

**Negotiation:**
- Back-and-forth offers
- Mediator conveys positions
- Creative solutions explored
- Compromise positions developed

**Resolution or impasse:**
- Agreement reached → Document settlement
- No agreement → Return to litigation

**Success rate:** 70-80% of trust mediations settle

## Settlement Structures

### Full Settlement

**Complete resolution:**
- All claims resolved
- All parties sign agreement
- Litigation dismissed
- Final and binding

**Example:**
- Contest alleges undue influence
- Settlement: Contestant receives $300,000
- Drops all claims
- Trust administered per remaining terms

### Partial Settlement

**Some issues resolved:**
- Certain claims settled
- Others proceed to trial
- Narrow remaining disputes

**Example:**
- Settle compensation dispute
- Continue litigating trust validity

### Structured Settlements

**Creative solutions:**

**Global family settlement:**
- Modify trust for all beneficiaries
- Everyone compromises
- New agreed terms

**Buyout:**
- Contestant paid lump sum
- Withdraws from trust
- Other beneficiaries continue

**Reformed trust:**
- Court approves modified trust
- Addresses concerns
- All parties agree to new terms

**Installment payments:**
- Settlement paid over time
- Secured by trust assets
- Interest paid

### Tax Considerations

**Settlement payments:**
- Typically not taxable if return of inheritance
- Legal fees may be taxable
- Consult tax advisor

**Structured carefully** to minimize tax consequences

## Common Settlement Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Capacity Challenge

**Dispute:**
- New trust gives daughter 90%
- Prior trust split 50/50 between two daughters
- Son alleges lack of capacity

**Settlement:**
- Son receives 30% instead of 10%
- Daughter keeps 70% instead of 90%
- Both avoid trial risk

**Rationale:**
- Son avoids risk of losing completely

### Scenario 2: Undue Influence

**Dispute:**
- Caregiver receives $500,000 bequest
- Children allege undue influence
- Evidence mixed

**Settlement:**

- Children receive balance
- No admission of wrongdoing

**Rationale:**
- Caregiver avoids risk of getting nothing
- Children avoid risk caregiver keeps $500,000
- Compromise reflects litigation risk

### Scenario 3: Trust Administration Dispute

**Dispute:**
- Trustee compensation excessive
- Beneficiary challenges $200,000 in fees
- Trustee claims justified

**Settlement:**
- Reduce fees to $125,000
- Trustee provides detailed accounting
- Continue as trustee

**Rationale:**
- Avoids trustee removal litigation
- Beneficiary gets some fee reduction
- Trust administration continues

### Scenario 4: Multiple Beneficiary Dispute

**Dispute:**
- Three siblings, unequal distributions
- Two contest trust
- Complex family dynamics

**Settlement:**
- Modify distributions
- Create new agreed trust
- All sign settlement

**Rationale:**
- Preserves family relationships
- Everyone compromises
- Avoids years of litigation

## Negotiation Strategies

### Assess Your Case Objectively

**Before mediation:**
- Evaluate evidence honestly
- Consider weaknesses
- Assess trial risks
- Calculate best/worst case scenarios

**Reality check:**
- What's likely outcome at trial?
- What are real odds of success?
- Factor in appeal risk

### Determine Settlement Range

**Calculate:**
- **Best case:** Full victory minus costs/time
- **Worst case:** Complete loss plus costs
- **Settlement range:** Between these extremes

**Example:**
- Best case: Win $1M (minus $200K costs/time value) = $800K
- Worst case: Lose everything plus $150K costs = -$150K
- **Settlement range: $200K-$600K acceptable**

### Understand Other Side's Position

**Consider their perspective:**
- What are their risks?
- What do they fear most?
- What creative solutions might work?
- What do they really need (vs. want)?

**Empathy helps settlement:**
- Understanding motivations
- Finding common ground
- Crafting win-win solutions

### Start Reasonably

**Opening position:**
- Not too extreme
- Room to negotiate
- Shows good faith
- Credible

**Don't:**
- Start at best case scenario
- Make insulting offers
- Appear unreasonable

### Make Principled Offers

**Base offers on:**
- Legal merits
- Evidence strength
- Comparable settlements
- Litigation costs avoided

**Not on:**
- Emotions
- Punishment desire
- Unrealistic expectations

### Focus on Interests, Not Positions

**Positional:**
"I want 50% of the estate."

**Interest-based:**
"I need financial security and want to be treated fairly."

**Interest-based negotiation** opens creative solutions

### Use Mediator Effectively

**Leverage mediator to:**
- Reality-test your position
- Deliver tough messages
- Float trial balloons
- Break impasses
- Suggest creative solutions

**Be candid with mediator** in private caucus

### Know Your Walk-Away Point

**Determine in advance:**
- Minimum acceptable settlement
- When to walk away
- What happens if no settlement

**Don't settle below walk-away** just for closure

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When is the best time to mediate a trust dispute?

The optimal time for mediation is typically after discovery is completed but before trial preparation begins—usually 12-18 months into litigation. At this point, both sides have enough information about the evidence and case strengths to negotiate realistically, but haven't incurred the massive costs of expert witnesses and trial preparation. However, mediation can succeed earlier for simpler disputes where the facts are clear and both parties want to avoid litigation costs.

### What happens if mediation fails and we can't reach a settlement?

If mediation doesn't result in settlement, the litigation continues toward trial. You're not bound by any positions taken during mediation, as the process is confidential. Many cases that don't settle at first mediation eventually settle later—sometimes through a second mediation attempt, direct negotiations between attorneys, or on the courthouse steps before trial as the reality of trial costs and risks becomes clearer.

### How much can I realistically save by settling instead of going to trial?

Settlement typically saves $100,000 to $350,000 compared to trial. Mediation and settlement costs usually total $65,000-$140,000, while taking a case through trial costs $200,000-$500,000 or more. Beyond direct cost savings, settlement saves years of time (receive your inheritance 1-3 years sooner), emotional stress, and often preserves some family relationships. The certainty of settlement outcome versus trial risk is also valuable.

### Can the mediator force us to settle or make a decision for us?

No. The mediator is a neutral facilitator who helps parties communicate and explore settlement options, but has no power to force a settlement or make binding decisions. That's arbitration, not mediation. In mediation, all settlement decisions are voluntary—you control the outcome. The mediator can reality-test your positions and suggest creative solutions, but you're free to reject any settlement proposal and proceed to trial if you choose.

### Should I accept a settlement offer that's less than I think I deserve?

Consider the offer against realistic trial outcomes, not ideal hopes. Calculate your expected value at trial by weighing best-case and worst-case scenarios against their probabilities, then subtract litigation costs and time value. If the settlement falls within your reasonable range and avoids trial risks, it may be wise even if less than you hoped for. Consult your attorney about the strength of your evidence, trial risks, and whether the offer is reasonable given the circumstances.
