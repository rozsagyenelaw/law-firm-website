When your spouse passes away, you're dealing with overwhelming grief while facing complex legal questions about property and assets. One of the most important questions: Do you need to go through formal probate to transfer your spouse's property to yourself?

As a Glendale probate attorney who has helped many surviving spouses navigate this process, I have good news: California provides a streamlined procedure called a **Spousal Property Petition** that allows surviving spouses to transfer property without the full expense and delay of formal probate.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain what a Spousal Property Petition is, when you can use it, the step-by-step process, Form DE-221 requirements, community property rules, timeline expectations, and how this compares to full probate.

## What Is a Spousal Property Petition?

A **Spousal Property Petition** is a simplified court procedure that allows surviving spouses or domestic partners to transfer property to themselves without full probate administration.

**Legal foundation:** California Probate Code Sections 13500-13660

**Also called:**
- Spousal Property Order
- Set-Aside to Surviving Spouse
- Confirmation of Property to Surviving Spouse

**Key benefits:**
- Faster than full probate (30-60 days vs. 12-18 months)
- Less expensive ($2,500-$5,000 vs. $20,000-$50,000+)
- Simpler process
- No executor appointment needed
- No formal estate administration
- No bond required
- No creditor publication required (in most cases)

**Primary form:** Spousal or Domestic Partner Property Petition (Form DE-221)

## When Can You Use a Spousal Property Petition?

Spousal Property Petitions are available only in specific situations involving community property and property passing to surviving spouse.

### Situation #1: Community Property to Surviving Spouse

**Most common use:** Confirming that community property passes to surviving spouse

**California Probate Code Section 13500**

**Requirements:**
- You were legally married or registered domestic partners
- Property is community property
- Property passes to you (either by will or by law)
- No probate proceeding is pending or granted

**What property qualifies:**
- Community real property
- Community bank accounts
- Community investment accounts
- Community business interests
- All property acquired during marriage (presumed community unless proven separate)

**Example:** You and your spouse owned your home as community property. After spouse's death, you want to transfer title to yourself alone. Spousal Property Petition confirms the property is yours.

### Situation #2: Separate Property Passing to Surviving Spouse

**California Probate Code Section 13650**

**When available:** Deceased spouse's separate property that passes to you

**Requirements:**
- Property passes to you under spouse's will, OR
- Property passes to you under intestate succession (no will)
- No probate proceeding is pending

**Example:** Your spouse inherited a house from their parents (separate property). Their will leaves it to you. Spousal Property Petition can transfer title to you.

### Situation #3: Property in Other Forms That Should Have Been Community

**California Probate Code Section 13502**

**Purpose:** Corrects situations where community property was improperly held in one spouse's name alone

**When used:**
- Property acquired during marriage
- Purchased with community funds
- Should be community property
- But titled in deceased spouse's name only

**Effect:** Court determines property is actually community property and confirms it passes to surviving spouse

## Property That CAN Be Transferred via Spousal Property Petition

**Real property:**
- Primary residence
- Vacation homes
- Rental properties
- Undeveloped land
- Any real estate

**Personal property:**
- Bank accounts
- Investment accounts
- Stocks and bonds
- Vehicles
- Business interests
- Personal belongings
- Any tangible or intangible property

**Important:** No dollar limit. Unlike small estate procedures, Spousal Property Petition works regardless of estate value.

## Property That CANNOT Be Transferred via Spousal Property Petition

**Property that doesn't qualify:**

**Assets with designated beneficiaries:**
- Life insurance with named beneficiary (passes directly)
- Retirement accounts (IRA, 401k) with beneficiary designation
- Payable-on-Death (POD) accounts
- Transfer-on-Death (TOD) accounts
- **Reason:** These pass by contract, not through probate

**Joint tenancy property:**
- Property held as joint tenants with right of survivorship
- **Reason:** Passes automatically to surviving joint tenant

**Trust property:**
- Assets held in revocable living trust
- **Reason:** Trust administration handles these

**Property passing to others:**
- Property left to children or other beneficiaries
- **Reason:** Spousal petition only transfers property to surviving spouse

## Community Property vs. Separate Property: Critical Distinction

Understanding California's community property rules is essential for determining what you can transfer via Spousal Property Petition.

### Community Property

**Definition:** Property acquired by either spouse during marriage

**Examples:**
- Salary and wages earned during marriage
- House purchased during marriage (with community funds)
- Investments made during marriage
- Business started during marriage
- Pension and retirement benefits earned during marriage

**Presumption:** All property acquired during marriage is community property unless proven otherwise

**Each spouse's share:** Each spouse owns 50% of all community property

**At death:** Deceased spouse's 50% share passes per their will or intestate succession. Surviving spouse already owns their 50% share.

**Common misconception:** Many people think if property is in deceased spouse's name alone, it's their separate property. Not true if acquired during marriage with community funds.

### Separate Property

**Definition:** Property that belongs to one spouse alone

**Examples:**
- Property owned before marriage
- Property acquired by gift or inheritance (even during marriage)
- Property acquired after legal separation
- Property designated as separate in prenuptial or postnuptial agreement
- Rents and profits from separate property

**At death:** Separate property passes entirely per deceased spouse's will or intestate succession

### Why This Matters for Spousal Property Petition

**Community property:** You already own half. Petition confirms the other half passes to you.

**Separate property:** You don't own any of it unless deceased spouse left it to you.

**Characterization disputes:** Sometimes it's unclear whether property is community or separate. Spousal Property Petition procedure includes process for determining property character.

## Spousal Property Petition Process: Step-by-Step

- Need court resolution of conflicts

**In these situations:** Must use full probate administration

**Combination approach:** Sometimes use Spousal Property Petition for property passing to spouse, plus limited probate for other assets
