# Lack of Capacity Trust Contest California: Proving Mental Incapacity

Lack of testamentary capacity is the most common ground for contesting a trust in California. When someone creates or modifies a trust while mentally incapacitated, those documents are invalid. However, proving lack of capacity requires understanding California's legal standard, gathering compelling medical evidence, and often battling the presumption that adults are competent.

This guide covers everything you need to know about capacity challenges in California trust litigation.

## California Capacity Standard

### The Legal Test (Probate Code §811)

To have testamentary capacity in California, the settlor must be able to:

1. **Understand the nature of the testamentary act** - Know they're creating/changing a trust
2. **Understand and recollect the nature and situation of their property** - Know what they own
3. **Remember and understand their relations to living descendants, spouse, parents, and those whose interests are affected** - Know their family
4. **Understand the practical effect and significance of the trust provisions** - Comprehend what the trust does

**All four elements required** - Failure of any one means incapacity.

### When Capacity Is Measured

**Critical moment:** Capacity assessed at the exact time trust was executed

**Not:**
- General capacity over months/years
- Capacity on other days
- Current capacity (if challenging old trust)

**Lucid intervals:**
Even if person generally incapacitated, trust valid if executed during "lucid interval" of capacity.

### Presumption of Capacity

**California law presumes all adults have capacity**

**Burden on contestant** to prove incapacity by clear and convincing evidence

**This makes capacity challenges difficult** - presumption favors validity.

## Medical Conditions Affecting Capacity

### Dementia

**Most common capacity issue**

**Types:**
- Alzheimer's disease (60-80% of dementia)
- Vascular dementia
- Lewy body dementia
- Frontotemporal dementia
- Mixed dementia

**Progression:**
- **Early stage:** Mild memory loss, some confusion
- **Middle stage:** Significant memory loss, confusion, poor judgment
- **Late stage:** Severe cognitive decline, cannot recognize family

**Trust executed in middle-late stage likely invalid**

### Alzheimer's Disease

**Progressive brain disease** destroying memory and thinking skills

**Symptoms affecting capacity:**
- Memory loss
- Confusion about time/place
- Difficulty with familiar tasks
- Poor judgment
- Personality changes
- Cannot follow complex instructions

**Timeline matters:**
- How long since diagnosis?
- What stage at trust execution?
- Medical records showing progression?

### Delirium

**Temporary confused state** often caused by:
- Medications
- Infections (UTI common in elderly)
- Hospitalization
- Surgery/anesthesia
- Dehydration

**Can cause temporary incapacity**

**Example:**
Elderly person signs trust while hospitalized with UTI-induced delirium = Potentially invalid

### Mental Illness

**Conditions that may affect capacity:**
- Severe depression with psychotic features
- Bipolar disorder (manic phase)
- Schizophrenia
- Paranoid delusions

**Must show condition actually impaired testamentary capacity**

### Stroke

**Can cause:**
- Cognitive impairment
- Aphasia (communication problems)
- Memory issues
- Executive function deficits

**Recent stroke** at time of trust execution raises capacity questions.

### Medications

**Drugs that can impair capacity:**
- Opioid pain medications
- Benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax)
- Sleep medications (Ambien)
- Certain antipsychotics
- Heavy sedation

**Must show:**
- What medications taken
- Dosage
- Timing relative to trust execution
- Known cognitive side effects

## Evidence of Incapacity

### Medical Records

**Most important evidence**

**Key medical documents:**
- **Diagnosis** of dementia, Alzheimer's, etc.
- **Doctor's notes** describing cognitive state
- **Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)** scores (0-30 scale, <24 suggests impairment)
- **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)** scores
- **Neuropsychological testing** results
- **Brain imaging** (CT, MRI) showing atrophy
- **Hospital records** if trust executed during hospitalization
- **Medication lists** and prescribing information

**Timeline crucial:**
Records closest to trust execution date most valuable.

### Lay Witness Testimony

**Family, friends, caregivers can testify about:**
- Confusion and disorientation
- Memory loss (repeating questions, forgetting conversations)
- Not recognizing family members
- Getting lost in familiar places
- Inability to manage finances
- Personality changes
- Decline in hygiene/self-care
- Difficulty with daily tasks

**Specific examples better than general statements**

**Example - Strong testimony:**
"On the day Mom signed the trust, she asked me three times who I was and thought it was 1985."

**Example - Weak testimony:**
"Mom seemed a bit confused sometimes."

### The Attorney's Testimony

**Attorney who prepared trust** is critical witness

**Attorney will testify about:**
- Settlor's appearance and demeanor
- Conversation about trust purposes
- Questions settlor asked
- Whether settlor understood provisions
- Any concerns about capacity
- Steps taken to assess capacity

**Problem:** Attorney almost always testifies settlor seemed competent (protects attorney from malpractice).

### Expert Testimony

**Forensic psychiatrist or neuropsychologist** reviews:
- Medical records
- Witness statements
- Deposition testimony
- Trust documents

**Expert opines:**
- Whether settlor had capacity
- How medical condition affected cognitive function
- Whether condition would impair testamentary capacity
- Consistency with described symptoms

**Expert costs:** $15,000-$50,000+

**Essential in most capacity cases**

## Common Capacity Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Progressive Dementia

**Facts:**
- 2015: Dementia diagnosis
- 2018: MMSE score 18/30 (moderate impairment)
- 2020: MMSE score 12/30 (severe impairment)
- 2020: Trust executed changing beneficiaries
- Family reports severe confusion by 2020

**Analysis:**
Strong capacity challenge - medical progression documented, severe impairment at execution.

### Scenario 2: Lucid Interval

**Facts:**
- Advanced dementia diagnosis
- Generally confused and disoriented
- Attorney testifies settlor was clear and coherent at signing
- Trust provisions make logical sense
- No medical records from exact date

**Analysis:**
Difficult case - Lucid interval defense available. Need strong lay testimony about confusion that same day.

### Scenario 3: Hospitalization

**Facts:**
- Trust signed in hospital
- Post-surgical, on pain medications
- Hospital records show disorientation
- Family wasn't notified of signing
- Rushed execution

**Analysis:**
Good capacity challenge - hospitalization, medications, disorientation documented.

### Scenario 4: Mild Cognitive Impairment

**Facts:**
- MCI diagnosis (not dementia)
- MMSE score 24/30 (borderline)
- Mostly independent
- Some memory issues
- Trust provisions logical

**Analysis:**
Weak capacity case - MCI alone usually insufficient. Need more evidence of impairment affecting testamentary capacity.

## Defending Against Capacity Challenge

### Proponent's Arguments

**Defense strategies:**

**1. Presumption of capacity**
- Contestant must overcome presumption
- Unless clearly proven, capacity presumed

**2. Attorney testimony**
- Attorney who prepared trust testifies settlor was competent
- Attorney would have noticed incapacity
- Attorney asked appropriate questions

**3. Rational trust provisions**
- Trust makes logical sense
- Provisions consistent with relationships
- No bizarre or irrational dispositions

**4. Lucid interval**
- Even if generally impaired, competent when executed
- Witnesses testify to clarity that day

**5. Medical evidence insufficient**
- Diagnosis doesn't equal incapacity
- Records not from date of execution
- Experts disagree

### Rebutting Defense

**Contestant responses:**

**Re: presumption**
- Present overwhelming evidence
- Medical records, multiple witnesses
- Expert testimony

**Re: attorney testimony**
- Attorney not medical expert
- Brief meeting insufficient to assess
- Attorney has bias (avoids malpractice)

**Re: rational provisions**
- Undue influence can coexist with incapacity
- Provisions favor person controlling settlor

**Re: lucid interval**
- Medical records show no lucid periods
- Witnesses testify to confusion that day
- No medical documentation of lucidity

## Capacity vs. Undue Influence

### Key Differences

**Capacity:**
- Medical/psychological condition
- Settlor couldn't understand

**Undue influence:**
- External pressure
- Settlor could understand but will overpowered

**Often alleged together:**
- Vulnerability from incapacity
- Made susceptible to influence

**Stronger case** when both alleged with supporting evidence.

## Procedural Issues

### Statute of Limitations

**120 days** from receiving notice trust became irrevocable

**Same as other trust contests** - act quickly

### Burden of Proof

**Contestant must prove incapacity by clear and convincing evidence**

**High standard** - more than "preponderance" (more likely than not)

**Must be "highly probable" settlor lacked capacity**

### Discovery

**Critical discovery:**
- **All medical records** from years before and including execution date
- **Attorney's file** from trust preparation
- **Depositions** of attorney, doctors, family, witnesses
- **Expert depositions**

**Medical records often under HIPAA**
- Need proper authorization
- Subpoena if necessary
- May need court order

## Settlement Considerations

### When to Settle

**Consider settlement if:**
- Medical evidence mixed
- Attorney testimony strong for capacity
- Lucid interval defensible
- Costly expert battle ahead
- Want to preserve family relationships

### Settlement Structures

**Common resolutions:**
- Modify trust to compromise
- Contestant receives more than contested trust provides
- Less than full victory but avoids trial risk

**Example:**
- Contested trust: Daughter gets $50,000
- Prior trust: Daughter got 50% ($500,000)
- **Settlement: Daughter receives $250,000**
- Avoids trial, both sides compromise

## Costs

### Attorney Fees

**Typical costs:**
- Through trial: $75,000-$200,000
- With appeals: $150,000-$350,000

### Expert Costs

- Forensic psychiatrist: $20,000-$50,000
- Neuropsychologist: $15,000-$40,000
- Medical records review: $5,000-$15,000

### Total Investment

**Complete capacity litigation:** $100,000-$300,000+

**Cost-benefit analysis essential**
