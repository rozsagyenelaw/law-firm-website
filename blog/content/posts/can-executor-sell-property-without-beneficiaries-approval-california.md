"Can I sell my mother's house without my siblings' approval? I'm the executor."

As a Glendale probate attorney, this is one of the most common questions I hear from executors. The answer depends entirely on what type of authority the executor has been granted by the court and whether the will contains specific provisions about selling property.

Understanding executor authority to sell property is critical—selling without proper authority can result in the sale being voided, personal liability for the executor, and serious family conflict.

This comprehensive guide explains when California executors can sell property without beneficiaries' approval, the difference between full authority (IAEA) and limited authority, court confirmation requirements, when beneficiary consent is needed, and best practices to avoid disputes.

## The Short Answer

**It depends on the executor's authority:**

**✅ YES - Executor can sell without beneficiary approval if:**
- Executor has **full authority (IAEA)**
- Will specifically grants power to sell
- Court order authorizes sale

**❌ NO - Executor needs approval if:**
- Executor has **limited authority** (court confirmation required)
- Will requires beneficiary consent
- Sale is below fair market value
- Beneficiaries successfully object to sale

**The key factor:** What type of authority the executor has been granted by the probate court.

## Types of Executor Authority in California

### Full Authority: Independent Administration of Estates Act (IAEA)

**California Probate Code Sections 10400-10592**

**IAEA grants executor broad powers** to administer estate without ongoing court supervision.

**With IAEA authority, executor can:**
- Sell real and personal property at fair market value
- Pay debts and expenses
- Invest estate assets
- Distribute property to beneficiaries
- Operate estate businesses
- **All without court approval**

**Beneficiary consent NOT required.**

**How to obtain IAEA authority:**

**Requirements:**
1. Will must waive bond requirement, OR
2. All beneficiaries consent to IAEA, OR
3. Executor posts bond and petitions for IAEA

**Requested in:** Original petition for probate

**Granted at:** First probate hearing (if requirements met)

**Standard practice:** Most attorneys request IAEA authority in every probate petition because it dramatically simplifies administration.

### Limited Authority: Traditional Probate

**Without IAEA, executor has limited authority.**

**Executor must obtain court approval for:**
- Selling real property
- Selling personal property over certain values
- Borrowing money
- Compromising claims
- Other significant transactions

**Court confirmation required for real estate sales.**

**This is the default** if IAEA is not granted.

### Will-Granted Authority

**Some wills include specific provisions:**

**"I authorize my executor to sell any property without court approval or beneficiary consent."**

**Effect:** Supports granting IAEA authority, but court still must formally grant it.

**Will alone is not sufficient** - executor must still petition court for authority.

## IAEA Authority: Selling Without Court Approval

### How IAEA Works for Property Sales

**With full IAEA authority:**

**Executor can:**
1. List property for sale with real estate agent
2. Accept offers at fair market value
3. Enter into purchase contracts
4. Close escrow
5. Transfer title to buyer

**NO court confirmation hearing required.**

**NO beneficiary approval needed.**

**Timeline:** 30-45 days from offer to close (normal real estate transaction).

### Limitations Even With IAEA

**IAEA is not unlimited power.**

**Executor must still:**
- Sell at fair market value
- Act in estate's best interests
- Maintain fiduciary duties
- Not self-deal
- Keep beneficiaries reasonably informed

**Cannot:**
- Sell to themselves without full disclosure and court approval
- Sell significantly below market value
- Sell to benefit executor personally
- Give away property

### Notice Requirements Under IAEA

**California Probate Code Section 10580-10582**

**Executor must give notice to beneficiaries:**

**15 days before** completing certain transactions, including property sales.

**Notice must state:**
- Description of property
- Terms of sale
- Sale price
- Buyer information

**Beneficiaries can object** by filing petition with court.

**But:** Objection does not automatically stop sale - court must rule objection has merit.

### Beneficiary Objections to IAEA Sale

**If beneficiary objects:**

**Process:**
1. Beneficiary files petition objecting to sale
2. Court hearing scheduled
3. Burden on beneficiary to show sale is improper
4. Judge rules whether sale can proceed

**Grounds for valid objection:**
- Sale price significantly below market value
- Executor self-dealing or conflict of interest
- Procedural irregularities
- Breach of fiduciary duty

**Frivolous objections:** Court will reject and allow sale to proceed.

## Limited Authority: Court Confirmation Required

### When Court Confirmation Is Required

**Without IAEA authority, executor needs court confirmation** to sell real property.

**Also required if:**
- Will doesn't waive bond
- IAEA wasn't requested
- IAEA was denied
- Estate is particularly complex

### Court Confirmation Process

**California Probate Code Sections 10300-10381**

**Step-by-step process:**

**1. Accept Initial Offer**
- Executor negotiates and accepts offer
- Offer must be at least 90% of appraised value
- Cannot close yet

**2. File Petition for Order Confirming Sale**
- Form: Petition for Order Confirming Sale of Real Property (Form DE-270)
- File with probate court
- Include purchase agreement

**3. Notice to Beneficiaries and Creditors**
- Mail notice at least 15 days before hearing
- Publish notice in newspaper

**4. Court Hearing**
- Scheduled 4-6 weeks after filing
- Overbidding may occur
- Judge confirms sale to highest bidder

**5. Close Escrow**
- After court order confirming sale
- 30 days to close typically

**Timeline:** 2-4 months from initial offer to close.

### Overbidding at Court Confirmation

**At confirmation hearing, anyone can make higher bids.**

**Overbidding rules:**
- Opening bid: 105% of accepted offer + $1,000
- Subsequent bids increase by set increments
- Cash or cashier's check deposit required
- Highest bidder wins

**Original buyer may be outbid** at hearing.

**This protects estate** by ensuring property sells for highest price.

### Beneficiary Role in Court Confirmation

**Beneficiaries can:**
- Attend hearing
- Object to sale
- Participate in bidding
- Question sale terms

**But:** Unless valid objection, court will confirm sale that's in estate's best interest.

**Valid objections:**
- Sale price too low
- Procedural errors
- Executor self-dealing
- Better offers available

## When Beneficiary Consent IS Required

### Specific Will Provisions

**If will states:**

"My executor shall not sell property without consent of all beneficiaries."

**Then:** Executor must obtain written consent from all beneficiaries before selling.

**This is rare** but when present, executor must comply.

### Family Allowance Situations

**If property is set aside for family allowance:**

**Executor cannot sell** without court approval and consideration of family needs.

### Community Property to Surviving Spouse

**If property passes to surviving spouse:**

**Spouse has veto power** over sale (it's becoming their property).

### Property Specifically Bequeathed

**If will states:** "I leave my house at 123 Main Street to my daughter Jane"

**Executor generally cannot sell** unless:
- Will also grants power to sell specific bequests
- Jane consents to sale
- Sale necessary to pay debts
- Court authorizes sale

## Executor's Fiduciary Duties Regarding Sales

**Even with authority to sell, executor must:**

### 1. Act in Best Interest of Estate

**Must:**
- Obtain fair market value
- Properly market property
- Consider all reasonable offers
- Not rush sale unless necessary

**Cannot:**
- Accept lowball offers
- Favor one beneficiary over others
- Make decisions based on personal benefit

### 2. Avoid Self-Dealing

**Cannot sell property to:**
- Yourself as executor
- Your family members
- Your business entities
- Anyone you have financial interest with

**Exception:** Full disclosure to beneficiaries and court, plus court approval.

### 3. Keep Beneficiaries Informed

**Should provide:**
- Notice of intent to sell
- Marketing plan
- Offers received
- Sale terms
- Closing timeline

**Not required:** Seek beneficiaries' approval (unless will requires).

**But good practice:** Keep beneficiaries informed to avoid disputes.

### 4. Obtain Fair Market Value

**Executor must:**
- Get property appraised
- List at reasonable price
- Consider market conditions
- Hire competent real estate agent

**Cannot:**
- Give property away
- Accept offers significantly below value without justification
- Sell as favor to friend or family

## Practical Considerations

### When to Sell Property

**Sell property when:**
- Will directs sale
- Estate needs cash for debts/expenses
- Beneficiaries don't want property
- Multiple beneficiaries (avoiding co-ownership)
- Property has carrying costs (mortgage, taxes)
- Market conditions favorable

### Communicating With Beneficiaries

**Best practices even without legal requirement:**

**Before listing:**
- Explain need to sell
- Share appraisal
- Discuss pricing strategy
- Address beneficiaries' concerns

**During marketing:**
- Update on showing activity
- Share offers received
- Explain reasoning for accepting/rejecting offers

**Benefits of communication:**
- Reduces likelihood of objections
- Builds trust
- Avoids litigation
- Smoother process

### Getting Beneficiary Consent (Even If Not Required)

**Strategic reasons to get consent:**
- Prevents future disputes
- Protects executor from liability
- Shows executor acted reasonably
- Speeds up process

**How to document:**
- Written consent from all beneficiaries
- State property address, sale price, terms
- Have notarized
- File with court

**Not legally required with IAEA,** but provides extra protection.

## What If Beneficiaries Disagree?

### Scenario: IAEA Authority, Beneficiaries Object

**Executor's position:**
- Has authority to sell without consent
- Beneficiaries' preference is not controlling
- Must act in estate's best interest

**Options:**

**1. Proceed with sale**
- Give required notice
- Complete sale as planned
- Defend decision if challenged

**2. Seek court guidance**
- File petition for instructions
- Court rules on whether sale appropriate
- Protects executor from liability

**3. Negotiate with beneficiaries**
- Understand their concerns
- Adjust plans if reasonable
- Document any agreements

### Scenario: Limited Authority, Beneficiaries Object

**Court confirmation process includes:**
- Opportunity for beneficiaries to object
- Judge evaluates objections
- Sale confirmed if in estate's interest

**Beneficiaries' objection does not veto sale** unless court agrees.

### When Beneficiaries Can Stop Sale

**Sale can be stopped if beneficiaries prove:**

1. **Executor lacks authority** (no IAEA, no court order)
2. **Sale price unconscionably low**
3. **Executor self-dealing or fraud**
4. **Procedural violations**
5. **Will prohibits sale**
6. **Sale harms estate interests**

**Burden is on beneficiaries** to prove sale is improper.

## Consequences of Selling Without Proper Authority

### If Executor Sells Without Authority

**Consequences:**

1. **Sale can be voided** by court
2. **Buyer may sue** for specific performance or damages
3. **Executor personally liable** for losses
4. **Breach of fiduciary duty**
5. **Possible removal** as executor
6. **Surcharge** against executor

**Example:**
Executor without IAEA sells property without court confirmation. Beneficiary objects. Court voids sale. Buyer sues estate. Executor may be personally liable for buyer's damages.

### If Executor Sells Below Fair Value

**Even with authority, selling significantly below value is breach of duty.**

**Consequences:**
- Beneficiaries can sue for difference
- Executor may be surcharged
- Removal as executor possible

### Protection for Buyers

**Buyers should verify:**
- Executor has authority (check letters and court orders)
- IAEA granted (if no court confirmation)
- Proper notices given
- Sale price reasonable

**Title insurance protects buyers** from most executor authority issues.

## Special Situations

### Selling to Pay Estate Debts

**If estate is insolvent:**

**Executor must sell assets** to pay creditors, even if beneficiaries object.

**Creditors have priority over beneficiaries.**

**No beneficiary consent required** when sale necessary to pay debts.

### Selling Property Held in Trust

**If property in trust (not probate):**

**Trustee controls,** not executor.

Different rules apply - trust terms control.

### Selling Business Interests

**Closely held business:**
- May have buy-sell agreements
- Other owners may have first refusal rights
- Special valuation issues

**Executor should consult business attorney** before selling.

### Selling Personal Property

**Personal property (not real estate):**

**IAEA authority** usually covers without court confirmation.

**High-value items** (art, collectibles, vehicles) should be appraised and sold at reasonable prices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can beneficiaries force executor to sell property?

Not directly, but if will directs sale or estate needs cash for debts, executor may be required to sell. Beneficiaries can petition court if executor refuses to sell when appropriate.

### Can executor refuse to sell if beneficiaries want property sold?

If executor has discretion under will and selling is not necessary, yes. But executor must have valid reasons consistent with fiduciary duties.

### What if one beneficiary wants to buy the property?

This is self-dealing if executor is also that beneficiary. If different beneficiary wants to buy, executor must ensure fair market sale with disclosure to all beneficiaries.

### Can executor sell property before probate opens?

No. Executor has no authority until appointed by court and letters are issued.

### How long does executor have to sell property?

No specific deadline, but executor should act reasonably promptly. Holding property unnecessarily can breach fiduciary duty if it incurs costs or loses value.

### What if property needs repairs before selling?

Executor can make reasonable repairs to maintain value and marketability. Major improvements may require court approval.

### Can beneficiaries buy property at court confirmation hearing?

Yes, anyone can bid at confirmation hearing, including beneficiaries.
