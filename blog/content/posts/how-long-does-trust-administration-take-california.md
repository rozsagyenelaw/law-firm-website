One of the biggest advantages of a living trust is avoiding California's lengthy probate process. But trust administration isn't instant—there are still steps to complete, deadlines to meet, and legal requirements to follow.

So how long should you expect trust administration to take? Here's a realistic timeline.

## Short Answer: 3-12 Months

Most California trust administrations complete in 3-12 months, compared to 12-18 months for probate.

Simple trusts with cooperative beneficiaries can wrap up in 3-4 months. Complex trusts with real estate, tax issues, or disputes can take a year or longer.

## Trust Administration Timeline: Step by Step

### Phase 1: Immediate Steps (Weeks 1-2)

**What happens:**

- Successor trustee takes control
- Death certificates obtained
- Trust document reviewed
- Assets identified and secured
- Professional advisors contacted (attorney, CPA)

**Time required:** 1-2 weeks

### Phase 2: Required Notices (Days 1-60)

**What happens:**

- Trustee sends notice to all beneficiaries and heirs
- Notice includes trust information and 120-day contest period
- Deadline: Within 60 days of death (or becoming trustee)

**Time required:** Should be done within first 2-3 weeks

**Why it matters:** The 120-day contest period doesn't start until notice is sent. Delayed notice = delayed distribution.

### Phase 3: Asset Management (Months 1-4)

**What happens:**

- Trust EIN obtained from IRS
- Trust bank account opened
- Assets inventoried and valued
- Real estate managed or prepared for sale
- Income collected (rents, dividends, etc.)
- Bills and ongoing expenses paid

**Time required:** Ongoing throughout administration

### Phase 4: Contest Period (120 Days)

**What happens:**

- Beneficiaries and heirs have 120 days to contest the trust
- Clock starts when notice is properly served
- Trustee should NOT make final distributions during this period

**Time required:** 4 months from notice

**Why it matters:** Distributing assets before the contest period expires is risky. If someone later challenges the trust successfully, you may need to recover assets from beneficiaries.

### Phase 5: Debts and Taxes (Months 2-6)

**What happens:**

- Deceased's final debts identified and paid
- Final income tax return filed (deceased)
- Trust income tax return filed (Form 1041)
- Estate tax return if required (rare—only for estates over $13.61 million)

**Time required:** 2-4 months, depending on tax complexity

**Key deadline:** Deceased's final tax return due April 15 of following year (or extension)

### Phase 6: Asset Distribution (After Contest Period)

**What happens:**

- Trust assets distributed to beneficiaries
- Real estate transferred via trustee's deed
- Accounts retitled or distributed
- Personal property delivered
- Final accounting provided to beneficiaries

**Time required:** 2-4 weeks for simple distributions; longer if real estate must be sold

### Phase 7: Trust Closure (Final Month)

**What happens:**

- Final trust tax return filed
- Records organized and stored
- Trust accounts closed
- Administration complete

**Time required:** 2-4 weeks

## Sample Timelines by Trust Type

### Simple Trust: 3-4 Months

**Characteristics:**

- One or two beneficiaries
- No real estate (or simple transfer to one beneficiary)
- No significant debts
- Cooperative family
- No tax complications

**Timeline:**

- Weeks 1-2: Take control, send notices
- Months 1-4: Wait for contest period
- Month 4-5: Distribute assets, close trust

### Moderate Trust: 6-9 Months

**Characteristics:**

- Multiple beneficiaries
- Real estate to sell or transfer
- Some debts to pay
- Tax returns required
- Family gets along

**Timeline:**

- Weeks 1-4: Notices, inventory, secure assets
- Months 2-4: Manage property, pay debts, file taxes
- Month 5: Contest period expires
- Months 5-8: Sell real estate, distribute assets
- Month 9: Final accounting, close trust

### Complex Trust: 12+ Months

**Characteristics:**

- Many beneficiaries
- Multiple properties
- Business interests
- Tax complications
- Family disputes
- Ongoing sub-trusts created

**Timeline:**

- Months 1-2: Notices, inventory, professional team assembled
- Months 2-6: Manage assets, resolve issues, file taxes
- Month 5: Contest period expires
- Months 6-12: Sell assets, resolve disputes, fund sub-trusts
- Month 12+: Final distributions, accounting, closure

## What Slows Down Trust Administration?

### Real Estate Sales

Selling property takes time:

- Preparing the home: 2-4 weeks
- Listing to accepted offer: 4-12 weeks
- Escrow to closing: 4-6 weeks

If the trust requires selling real estate, add 3-5 months to your timeline.

### Tax Issues

Complex tax situations delay distribution:

- Waiting for prior year returns to process
- Amended returns needed
- Estate tax return required (9-month deadline, often extended)
- Business tax complications

### Family Disputes

Disagreements among beneficiaries can extend administration significantly:

- Disputes over asset values
- Disagreements about selling property
- Accusations against trustee
- Litigation

### Missing Assets or Documents

Tracking down assets takes time:

- Accounts with unknown institutions
- Safe deposit boxes
- Out-of-state property
- Lost or incomplete records

### Trustee Inexperience

Inexperienced trustees often:

- Miss deadlines
- Make procedural errors
- Delay making decisions
- Fail to hire professional help when needed

## Can Distribution Happen Before 120 Days?

**Preliminary distributions:** Yes, trustees can make partial distributions before the contest period expires—but it's risky.

**Why trustees wait:** If someone successfully contests the trust after distribution, the trustee may be personally liable for recovering assets.

**When early distribution makes sense:**

- Beneficiaries have urgent financial needs
- Trust contest is extremely unlikely
- Trustee reserves sufficient funds for potential claims
- All beneficiaries consent

**Best practice:** Wait until the 120-day period expires for final distributions unless there's compelling reason not to.

## Trust Administration vs. Probate Timeline

| Phase | Trust | Probate |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Getting started | 1-2 weeks | 4-6 weeks (court hearing) |
| Contest/creditor period | 120 days | 4 months (creditors) + 120 days (contests) |
| Asset management | Ongoing | Court oversight required |
| Distribution | After contest period | Court approval required |
| Total typical | 3-12 months | 12-18 months |

Even complex trust administrations usually finish faster than simple probates.

## How to Speed Up Trust Administration

**Start immediately:** Don't wait to begin. Send notices, get the EIN, and inventory assets right away.

**Hire professionals early:** An experienced attorney and CPA prevent delays from mistakes.

**Communicate with beneficiaries:** Keep them informed to prevent suspicion and disputes.

**Stay organized:** Track deadlines, keep records, and maintain a checklist.

**Make decisions:** Trustees who procrastinate extend administration unnecessarily.

**Address problems proactively:** Don't let issues fester—deal with them immediately.
