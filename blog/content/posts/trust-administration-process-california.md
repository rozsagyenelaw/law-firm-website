If you're facing trust administration for the first time, the process can feel overwhelming. What steps are required? How long will it take? What are the legal obligations?

This guide provides a high-level overview of the entire California trust administration process from start to finish—so you understand the big picture before diving into the details.

## What Is Trust Administration?

Trust administration is the process of managing and distributing a living trust's assets after the trust creator (grantor/settlor) dies. It's the trust equivalent of probate—but faster, cheaper, and private because it happens outside the court system.

**The goal:** Carry out the grantor's wishes by paying debts, handling taxes, and distributing assets to the people the grantor chose to receive them.

## Trust Administration vs. Probate

| Factor | Trust Administration | Probate |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| Court involved? | No (usually) | Yes |
| Timeline | 3-12 months | 12-18+ months |
| Cost | $3,000-$15,000 typical | $25,000-$100,000+ |
| Privacy | Completely private | Public record |
| Court supervision | None | Required |
| Flexibility | Trustee-directed | Court-controlled |

Trust administration is generally simpler and more flexible because there's no judge looking over your shoulder at every step.

## Who Is Involved?

### The Successor Trustee

The person who takes over management of the trust after the grantor dies. They're responsible for the entire administration process.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Securing and managing assets
- Sending required notices
- Paying debts and taxes
- Distributing to beneficiaries

### The Beneficiaries

The people entitled to receive trust assets. They have rights to:

- Receive notice of the trust
- Request information about the trust
- Receive accountings
- Receive their distributions

### Professional Advisors

Most trust administrations involve:

- **Attorney:** Legal guidance and document preparation
- **CPA/Accountant:** Tax return preparation
- **Appraiser:** Asset valuations (if needed)
- **Financial advisor:** Investment management (if needed)

## The Trust Administration Process: 7 Phases

### Phase 1: Taking Control

**When:** Immediately after death
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

**What happens:**

The successor trustee steps into their role and takes control of trust assets. Unlike probate, there's no court appointment needed—authority begins automatically.

**Key tasks:**

- Locate and review the trust document
- Obtain death certificates (10-15 copies)
- Secure the home and valuables
- Notify key parties (banks, insurance, etc.)
- Begin identifying all trust assets

**Critical point:** The trustee has authority from day one, but should act carefully until they fully understand the trust's terms and assets.

### Phase 2: Establishing Authority

**When:** Weeks 2-4
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

**What happens:**

The trustee formalizes their authority and sets up administrative infrastructure.

**Key tasks:**

- Apply for trust EIN (tax ID number)
- Open trust bank account
- Prepare trustee certification
- Record affidavit of death (for real property)
- Notify financial institutions
- Establish record-keeping system

**Critical point:** Use the trust's EIN—not the deceased's Social Security number—for all trust transactions going forward.

### Phase 3: Notice and Inventory

**When:** Month 1-2
**Duration:** 4-8 weeks

**What happens:**

The trustee sends legally required notices and creates a comprehensive inventory of everything the trust owns and owes.

**Key tasks:**

- Send 60-day notice to all beneficiaries and heirs (REQUIRED)
- Inventory all assets with values
- Inventory all debts and liabilities
- Obtain appraisals where needed
- Document date-of-death values (for tax purposes)

**Critical point:** The 60-day notice deadline is strict. Missing it can extend the trust contest period indefinitely.

### Phase 4: Administration Period

**When:** Months 2-5
**Duration:** 3-4 months (minimum)

**What happens:**

The trustee manages trust assets, pays ongoing expenses, addresses creditors, and waits for the contest period to expire.

**Key tasks:**

- Manage real property (maintenance, insurance, taxes)
- Collect income (rent, dividends, interest)
- Pay legitimate debts
- Maintain insurance coverage
- Communicate with beneficiaries
- Wait for 120-day contest period to pass

**Critical point:** Don't rush to distribute assets. The 120-day contest period must expire first, and all debts and taxes must be addressed.

### Phase 5: Taxes

**When:** Throughout administration, with specific deadlines
**Duration:** Ongoing

**What happens:**

The trustee handles all tax obligations for both the deceased person and the trust.

**Tax returns typically required:**

| Return | What It Covers | Deadline |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Final Form 1040/540 | Deceased's income (Jan 1 - death date) | April 15 following year |
| Form 1041/541 | Trust income after death | April 15 following year |
| Form 706 | Estate tax (if over $13.61 million) | 9 months from death |

**Critical point:** Tax mistakes can be costly. Most trustees work with a CPA for this phase.

### Phase 6: Distribution

**When:** After contest period and debts/taxes settled
**Duration:** 2-8 weeks

**What happens:**

The trustee distributes trust assets to beneficiaries according to the trust's terms.

**Key tasks:**

- Calculate each beneficiary's share
- Prepare transfer documents (deeds, assignments)
- Distribute cash to beneficiaries
- Transfer real estate
- Distribute investments
- Deliver personal property
- Obtain receipts from beneficiaries

**Distribution methods by asset type:**

| Asset | How It's Distributed |
|-------|---------------------|
| Cash | Check or wire transfer |
| Real estate | Trustee's deed recorded with county |
| Investments | Transfer to beneficiary's account |
| Vehicles | Title transfer at DMV |
| Personal property | Physical delivery |

**Critical point:** Get signed receipts from every beneficiary acknowledging what they received.

### Phase 7: Closing

**When:** After all distributions complete
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks

**What happens:**

The trustee wraps up all remaining tasks and formally closes the trust administration.

**Key tasks:**

- Prepare final accounting
- Provide accounting to beneficiaries
- File final trust tax returns
- Close trust bank accounts
- Obtain releases from beneficiaries (recommended)
- Store records securely

**Critical point:** Keep all records for at least 5-7 years in case questions arise later.

## Timeline: How Long Does It Take?

Trust administration timelines vary based on complexity:

### Simple Trust: 3-6 Months

- One or two beneficiaries
- No real estate (or simple transfer)
- Few accounts
- No disputes
- Cooperative beneficiaries

### Moderate Trust: 6-12 Months

- Multiple beneficiaries
- Real estate to sell
- Multiple accounts
- Some tax complexity
- No significant disputes

### Complex Trust: 12-18+ Months

- Many beneficiaries
- Multiple properties
- Business interests
- Tax complications
- Disputes or litigation
- Sub-trusts required

## Key Deadlines to Remember

| Deadline | Task |
|----------|------|
| Immediately | Secure assets |
| ASAP | Get death certificates |
| 60 days | Send statutory notice to beneficiaries/heirs |
| 120 days after notice | Contest period expires |
| April 15 | Deceased's final income tax return |
| April 15 | Trust income tax return |
| 9 months | Estate tax return (if required) |

## Common Complications

### Real Estate Sales

If the trust owns property that must be sold:

- Add 3-5 months to timeline
- Requires listing, selling, and closing
- Title issues may need resolution
- Capital gains implications

### Business Interests

If the trust includes business ownership:

- Valuation required
- May need to coordinate with partners
- Operating agreements affect options
- Can significantly extend timeline

### Family Disputes

If beneficiaries are in conflict:

- Everything takes longer
- May require mediation
- Could escalate to litigation
- Costs increase substantially

### Tax Complications

If tax issues are complex:

- Estate tax returns take months
- Audits can delay closure
- Amended returns may be needed
- Professional help essential

## What Can Go Wrong?

**Missing the 60-day notice deadline:** Contest period never starts; trust remains in limbo.

**Distributing too early:** If a claim arises later, trustee may be personally liable.

**Poor record-keeping:** Can't prove what happened; vulnerable to challenges.

**Ignoring beneficiaries:** Breeds suspicion; may trigger legal action.

**Tax mistakes:** Penalties, interest, and potential personal liability.

**Self-dealing:** Using trustee position for personal benefit is prohibited.

## When Court Gets Involved

Most trust administrations never see a courtroom. But courts can get involved for:

- Trust contests (challenges to validity)
- Disputes between trustee and beneficiaries
- Requests to interpret unclear trust terms
- Trustee removal petitions
- Approval of trustee fees
- Modification of irrevocable trusts

If litigation occurs, the process becomes longer and more expensive.

## Do You Need an Attorney?

**Technically, no.** California law doesn't require attorney involvement.

**Practically, usually yes.** Most trust administrations benefit from professional guidance:

- Ensures legal requirements are met
- Protects trustee from liability
- Handles complex documents
- Navigates tax issues
- Prevents costly mistakes
- Attorney fees come from trust assets

**Consider DIY only if:**

- Trust is extremely simple
- No real estate involved
- Only one or two beneficiaries
- Everyone gets along
- You have relevant experience

## Understanding the Big Picture

Trust administration follows a logical progression:

1. **Take control** → Secure assets and understand what you're working with
2. **Establish authority** → Set up the infrastructure to act as trustee
3. **Notify and inventory** → Tell required parties and document everything
4. **Administer** → Manage assets, pay debts, wait for contest period
5. **Handle taxes** → File all required returns
6. **Distribute** → Give beneficiaries what they're entitled to
7. **Close** → Wrap up and store records

Each phase builds on the previous one. Trying to skip steps or rush the process creates problems.
