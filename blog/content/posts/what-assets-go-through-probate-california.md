"Do I need to go through probate for my mother's house? What about her bank accounts?"

As a Glendale probate attorney, this is one of the most common questions I hear from families dealing with a loved one's death. The answer depends entirely on how assets were titled and whether beneficiaries were designated.

Understanding which assets go through probate—and which don't—is critical for both families handling an estate and anyone doing estate planning to help their family avoid probate.

This comprehensive guide explains exactly which assets require California probate, which assets pass outside probate, the $184,500 threshold that matters, and proven strategies to keep assets out of probate entirely.

## What Does "Going Through Probate" Mean?

**Probate** is the court-supervised legal process of:
- Validating a will (if one exists)
- Appointing an executor or administrator
- Identifying and inventorying assets
- Paying debts and taxes
- Distributing remaining assets to beneficiaries

**California probate typically takes:**
- **Timeline:** 12-18 months minimum
- **Cost:** $20,000-$100,000+ in fees
- **Public record:** Court files are accessible to anyone

**Assets that "go through probate"** must be transferred through this formal court process.

**Assets that "pass outside probate"** transfer directly to beneficiaries without court involvement.

## The $184,500 Threshold

**California Probate Code Section 13100**

**If total probate assets are worth $184,500 or less**, heirs can use simplified procedures instead of formal probate:
- Small estate affidavit
- Affidavit for Real Property (if real estate under $61,500)

**If probate assets exceed $184,500**, formal probate is required.

**Note:** This threshold is for probate assets only. Non-probate assets don't count toward this limit.

## Assets That GO THROUGH Probate

### 1. Real Estate in Deceased's Name Alone

**Probate required if:**
- Deed shows decedent as sole owner
- Titled as "tenants in common" (not joint tenancy)
- No transfer-on-death deed
- Not held in trust

**Examples:**
- House owned solely by decedent
- Vacant land in decedent's name
- Rental property without beneficiary designation
- Timeshare in individual name

**Even if will says "leave house to daughter,"** probate is required to transfer title.

### 2. Bank Accounts in Sole Name (No Beneficiary)

**Probate required if:**
- Account in decedent's name only
- No "payable on death" (POD) beneficiary
- Not joint account with right of survivorship

**Examples:**
- Checking account: "John Smith"
- Savings account without POD designation
- Certificates of deposit (CDs) without beneficiary

**The bank cannot release funds without probate.**

### 3. Investment Accounts Without Transfer-on-Death

**Probate required if:**
- Brokerage account in sole name
- No "transfer on death" (TOD) beneficiary
- Individual account (not joint)

**Examples:**
- E*TRADE account: "Mary Johnson"
- Vanguard account without TOD
- Individual stock certificates

### 4. Vehicles in Decedent's Name Only

**Generally probate required** unless using simplified DMV procedures.

**Exception:** California allows simplified transfer for vehicles if estate qualifies for small estate procedures.

**Probate needed for:**
- Cars, trucks, motorcycles
- Boats
- RVs
- Aircraft

**Without additional owners or TOD beneficiary.**

### 5. Business Interests Without Succession Plan

**Probate required for:**
- Sole proprietorships
- Partnership interests without buy-sell agreement
- LLC membership interests in individual name
- Corporate stock in individual name
- Professional practices

### 6. Personal Property in Deceased's Name

**Probate may be required for:**
- Jewelry
- Art and collectibles
- Furniture and household items
- Valuable personal effects

**Practical reality:** Small personal items often distributed informally, but technically should go through probate if estate exceeds $184,500.

### 7. Money Owed to Decedent

**Probate required to collect:**
- Promissory notes payable to decedent
- Lawsuit settlements
- Unpaid wages or commissions
- Security deposits
- Tax refunds (sometimes)

### 8. Intellectual Property Rights

**Probate required for:**
- Copyrights
- Patents
- Royalty rights
- Licensing agreements

### 9. Cryptocurrency in Individual Wallets

**Probate likely required** if:
- Crypto held in personal wallet (not exchange)
- No beneficiary designation
- Access requires private keys

**Practical challenge:** Locating and accessing crypto can be difficult.

## Assets That DO NOT Go Through Probate

### 1. Joint Tenancy Property (With Right of Survivorship)

**Passes automatically to surviving joint tenant(s).**

**Requirements:**
- Deed or title must specify "joint tenancy"
- Must say "with right of survivorship"
- Surviving owner inherits automatically

**Examples:**
- House: "John Smith and Mary Smith, as joint tenants"
- Bank account: "Joint tenants with right of survivorship"

**Process:**
- Record death certificate with county recorder
- Property passes to survivor immediately
- No probate required

**Important:** If all joint tenants die, probate is required.

### 2. Community Property with Right of Survivorship

**California allows this special title form.**

**Passes automatically to surviving spouse** without probate.

**Requirements:**
- Must be married or registered domestic partners
- Deed must say "community property with right of survivorship"

**Advantage over regular community property:** Regular community property may require spousal property petition; this form passes automatically.

### 3. Assets in Living Trust

**Trust assets avoid probate entirely.**

**If property titled:**
- "John Smith, Trustee of the Smith Family Trust"
- Assets held in trust name

**At death:**
- Successor trustee takes over
- Distributes assets per trust terms
- No court involvement (trust administration is private)

**Most effective probate avoidance strategy.**

### 4. Payable-on-Death (POD) Bank Accounts

**Bank accounts with POD beneficiaries pass directly to beneficiaries.**

**How it works:**
- Account owner designates beneficiary on bank form
- Account remains in owner's control during life
- At death, beneficiary presents death certificate to bank
- Bank transfers funds directly to beneficiary

**Also called:** Totten trust, in trust for (ITF) account

### 5. Transfer-on-Death (TOD) Investment Accounts

**Brokerage accounts with TOD beneficiaries pass outside probate.**

**Process:**
- Owner completes TOD registration form
- Beneficiary has no rights until owner's death
- At death, beneficiary provides death certificate
- Assets transfer directly

**California law** allows TOD registration for stocks, bonds, and brokerage accounts.

### 6. Retirement Accounts with Beneficiary Designations

**Pass directly to named beneficiaries:**

- **401(k) plans** → To designated beneficiary
- **IRA accounts** → To designated beneficiary
- **403(b) plans** → To designated beneficiary
- **Pension benefits** → Per plan rules

**Critical:** Beneficiary designation controls, even if will says something different.

**Common problem:** Outdated beneficiary designations (ex-spouse still listed).

### 7. Life Insurance Policies with Named Beneficiaries

**Death benefits pass directly to beneficiaries.**

**Process:**
- Beneficiary files claim with insurance company
- Provides death certificate
- Receives proceeds directly
- No probate required

**Exception:** If estate is named beneficiary, proceeds go through probate.

### 8. Transfer-on-Death Deeds for Real Estate

**California allows TOD deeds** (California Probate Code Section 5600).

**How it works:**
- Owner records revocable TOD deed
- Property stays in owner's control during life
- Owner can revoke anytime
- At death, property passes to named beneficiary
- Beneficiary records death certificate

**Advantages:**
- Avoids probate
- Retains full control during life
- Can be changed anytime
- Lower cost than trust

**Limitations:**
- Only for owner-occupied residential property (1-4 units)
- Can't use for rental or commercial property
- Can trigger property tax reassessment
- Limited protection compared to trust

### 9. Property Held in Survivorship Forms

**Special title forms that avoid probate:**

- **Tenancy by the entirety** (limited California recognition)
- **Joint tenancy**
- **Community property with right of survivorship**

### 10. Assets With Contractual Beneficiaries

**Any asset with valid beneficiary designation passes outside probate:**

- Annuities
- Certain bonds (with TOD)
- Credit union accounts with POD
- Some club memberships with transfer rights

## Special Situations and Grey Areas

### Community Property (Regular, Without Right of Survivorship)

**California community property without WROS designation:**

**Does it require probate?** Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

**Options for surviving spouse:**
1. **Spousal Property Petition** (simplified procedure)
2. **Full probate** (if other issues exist)
3. **Small estate procedures** (if under threshold)

**Not automatic transfer** like joint tenancy.

### Jointly Owned Property Without "Right of Survivorship"

**"Tenants in common" ownership:**

**Probate required** for deceased's share.

**Example:**
Property owned 50/50 as tenants in common.
- One owner dies
- Deceased's 50% goes through probate
- Surviving owner keeps their 50%

**Tenancy in common is default** in California unless deed specifies joint tenancy.

### Property in Decedent's Trust Not Properly Funded

**If trust exists but property wasn't transferred to it:**

**Probate required** because property is still in individual name.

**Common issue:** Trust created but real estate never deeded to trust.

**Solution during life:** Pour-over will (sends probate assets to trust after probate).

### Property Outside California

**California probate only covers California property.**

**Out-of-state real estate requires:**
- Ancillary probate in that state, OR
- Avoid by holding in trust

### Property Acquired After Trust Funded

**Property acquired after trust created:**

**Requires probate unless:**
- Specifically transferred to trust
- Has beneficiary designation
- Held in joint tenancy

### Retirement Accounts With No Beneficiary

**If retirement account has NO designated beneficiary:**

**Passes to estate → Requires probate**

**Also triggers worst tax consequences** (must be distributed quickly, losing tax deferral).

### Vehicles: Special California Rules

**California allows simplified transfer** for vehicles if:
- Estate qualifies for small estate procedures (under $184,500)
- Vehicle value under certain threshold

**DMV Form:** REG 5 (Affidavit for Transfer Without Probate)

**If estate exceeds threshold:** Vehicle technically requires probate, though often transferred informally.

## How to Determine If Probate Is Required

### Step 1: Make Complete Asset List

**List every asset decedent owned:**

| Asset | Title/Ownership | Estimated Value | Beneficiary? |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| House | Individual name | $800,000 | None |
| Bank account | POD to daughter | $50,000 | Yes |
| IRA | TOD to son | $200,000 | Yes |
| Car | Individual | $25,000 | None |

### Step 2: Identify Non-Probate Assets

**Remove from probate calculation:**
- Joint tenancy property
- Assets with beneficiaries
- Trust assets
- All non-probate transfers

### Step 3: Calculate Total Probate Assets

**Add up remaining assets in individual name:**

From example above:
- House: $800,000 (no beneficiary)
- Car: $25,000 (no beneficiary)
- **Total probate assets: $825,000**

**Conclusion:** Exceeds $184,500 → Formal probate required

### Step 4: Consider Simplified Procedures

**If total is $184,500 or less:**
- Small estate affidavit
- Simplified procedures
- No formal probate

## Strategies to Avoid Probate

### Strategy #1: Create Living Trust

**Most comprehensive solution.**

**How it works:**
- Transfer all assets to trust
- You remain trustee during life
- Successor trustee takes over at death
- Assets distributed per trust terms
- No probate required

**Best for:** California homeowners, anyone with assets over $200K

### Strategy #2: Add Transfer-on-Death Designations

**For specific assets:**
- Bank accounts → Add POD beneficiary
- Investment accounts → Add TOD beneficiary
- Consider TOD deed for real estate (if eligible)

**Advantage:** Simple, low-cost, retains full control

**Disadvantage:** Less comprehensive than trust, no incapacity planning

### Strategy #3: Convert to Joint Tenancy

**Add joint owner with right of survivorship.**

**Caution:**
- Joint owner has immediate rights to property
- Can't be undone without joint owner's consent
- May have gift tax implications
- Property becomes joint owner's community property if they're married

**Use carefully and with legal advice.**

### Strategy #4: Life Estate Deeds

**Transfer property but retain life estate:**
- You live in/use property during life
- Property passes to remainder beneficiary at death
- Avoids probate

**Downsides:**
- Can't sell easily without remainder beneficiary's consent
- Property tax issues
- Less flexible than trust

### Strategy #5: Beneficiary Designations on All Eligible Assets

**Maximum use of beneficiary designations:**
- Life insurance
- Retirement accounts
- Bank accounts (POD)
- Investment accounts (TOD)
- Any asset allowing beneficiary designation

**Remember:** Keep beneficiaries updated!

### Strategy #6: Gift Assets During Life

**Transfer property before death:**
- No longer in your estate at death
- No probate for gifted assets

**Consider:**
- Gift tax rules
- Loss of control
- Medicaid lookback (if relevant)

**Not usually recommended as primary strategy.**

### Strategy #7: Small Estate Planning

**If estate under $184,500:**
- May not need extensive planning
- Small estate procedures available
- Consider POD/TOD for convenience

## Common Probate Avoidance Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Failing to Fund Trust

**Creating trust but not transferring assets** defeats the purpose.

**All assets must be retitled** to trust to avoid probate.

### Mistake #2: Outdated Beneficiary Designations

**Most common issue I see:**

Ex-spouse still listed on 401(k) 10 years after divorce.

**Beneficiary designations override will.**

### Mistake #3: Assuming Joint Accounts Avoid Probate for Everyone

**Adding child as joint owner on account:**

- Child has immediate access
- Funds become child's if you don't spend them
- Other children may not receive fair share
- May cause gift tax issues

**Better:** POD designation

### Mistake #4: No Plan for Out-of-State Property

**Vacation home in another state requires ancillary probate** unless held in trust or joint tenancy.

### Mistake #5: DIY Estate Planning Without Full Understanding

**Using online forms without legal advice risks:**
- Invalid documents
- Incorrect titling
- Unintended tax consequences
- Assets not properly covered

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if someone dies with both probate and non-probate assets?

Non-probate assets transfer directly to beneficiaries. Probate assets go through probate. This is common.

### Do all assets have to go through probate if one asset requires it?

No. Only assets in individual name without beneficiaries require probate. Other assets transfer outside probate.

### How do I know how property is titled?

Check deed (for real estate), account statements, title documents. County recorder has property records. Banks can provide account registration.

### Can I avoid probate with just a will?

No. A will does NOT avoid probate. Wills must be probated. Only trusts and beneficiary designations avoid probate.

### What about property in an LLC?

If LLC membership interest is in your individual name, it goes through probate (unless in trust or other arrangement).

### Do retirement accounts ever go through probate?

Only if estate is named beneficiary or no beneficiary designated. Otherwise they pass directly to beneficiaries.

### What happens if property is titled incorrectly?

May require probate even if you intended to avoid it. This is why proper titling is critical.
