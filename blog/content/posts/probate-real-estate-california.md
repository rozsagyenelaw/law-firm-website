Real estate is often the largest and most complex asset in a California probate estate. As executor, you're responsible for protecting, maintaining, and ultimately selling or distributing property worth hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.

Handling probate real estate involves unique challenges: securing vacant property, maintaining insurance, paying ongoing expenses, deciding whether to sell, navigating court approval requirements, and ultimately transferring title to beneficiaries or buyers.

As a Glendale probate attorney who regularly advises executors on real estate issues, I've seen how proper property management protects estate value while mismanagement can result in property damage, liability, and loss of value.

This comprehensive guide explains everything executors need to know about probate real estate in California: initial property responsibilities, maintaining property during probate, selling estate real estate, court confirmation requirements, property tax issues, and distributing property to beneficiaries.

## Types of Real Estate in Probate

### Property That Goes Through Probate

**Probate required for:**
- Property in decedent's name alone
- Property held as tenants in common (decedent's share)
- Property with no beneficiary designation

### Property That Avoids Probate

**Passes outside probate:**
- Joint tenancy property → To surviving joint tenant
- Community property with right of survivorship → To surviving spouse
- Property in living trust → Per trust terms
- Property with transfer-on-death deed → To named beneficiary

**See our guide:** [What Assets Go Through Probate California](/blog/what-assets-go-through-probate-california/)

## Executor's Initial Property Responsibilities

### Step 1: Secure the Property

**Immediately after appointment:**

**Vacant property:**
- Change locks
- Install security system if needed
- Board up broken windows
- Secure all entry points
- Remove valuables

**Occupied property:**
- Determine who's living there
- Establish their legal rights
- Consider cash-for-keys agreements if needed

**Failure to secure property** = Potential liability for vandalism, theft, or damage.

### Step 2: Obtain Property Insurance

**Required: Probate property must be insured.**

**Coverage needed:**
- Homeowner's insurance (if occupied)
- Vacant property insurance (if empty)
- Liability coverage
- Sufficient replacement value

**Vacant property insurance:**
- Different from regular homeowner's insurance
- More expensive
- Specifically covers vacant properties
- Required by most carriers if vacant over 30-60 days

**Change named insured** to estate name.

### Step 3: Inventory and Photograph Property

**Document property condition:**

- Photograph every room
- Document any damage
- Note repairs needed
- Inventory personal property in home
- Check for hazards

**Protects executor** from claims property was damaged during probate.

### Step 4: Arrange Property Appraisal

**Required:** California probate requires professional appraisal by probate referee.

**Probate referee:**
- Appointed by court
- Determines fair market value
- Value included in inventory
- Affects probate fees

**Additional appraisal:**
- Consider independent real estate appraisal
- Helps determine listing price if selling
- Provides second opinion on value

### Step 5: Determine Property Status

**Key questions:**

**Mortgage:**
- Is there a mortgage?
- What's the balance?
- Are payments current?
- Who's making payments?

**Property taxes:**
- Are taxes current?
- When is next payment due?
- Is property tax exemption in place?

**HOA:**
- Is property in HOA?
- Are dues current?
- Any liens or violations?

**Tenants:**
- Is property rented?
- Is there a lease?
- Are tenants current on rent?
- When does lease expire?

## Maintaining Property During Probate

Executors must maintain property from date of appointment until sale or distribution.

### Ongoing Property Expenses

**Executor must pay from estate funds:**

**Required:**
- Property insurance
- Property taxes
- HOA dues
- Utilities (at minimum levels)
- Security monitoring

**As needed:**
- Maintenance and repairs

### Making Mortgage Payments

**If property has mortgage:**

**Executor's duty:** Continue making payments to avoid foreclosure.

**Options:**
1. Pay from estate funds
2. Rent property (use rent for mortgage)
3. Sell property quickly
4. Beneficiary makes payments (credited against inheritance)

**Don't let property go into foreclosure** unless:
- Property is underwater (worth less than debt)
- Estate cannot afford payments
- Court approves

### Property Maintenance Standards

**Executor must maintain property** in reasonably good condition.

**Required maintenance:**
- Roof repairs (prevent water damage)
- HVAC functionality
- Plumbing repairs
- Electrical safety
- Structural issues
- Pest infestations

- Set heating to minimum
- Prevent freeze damage
- Check regularly

## Deciding Whether to Sell or Distribute

**Executor must decide:**
- Sell property and distribute cash
- Distribute property to beneficiaries

### When to Sell

**Sell if:**

1. **Will directs sale**
2. **Beneficiaries agree to sale**
3. **Estate needs cash** for debts, taxes, or expenses
4. **Property cannot be divided** fairly among multiple beneficiaries
5. **Beneficiaries don't want property**
6. **Mortgage exceeds value** (short sale)

### When to Distribute Property

**Distribute if:**

1. **Will directs distribution** to specific person
2. **Single beneficiary** wants property
3. **Beneficiaries agree** on who gets property
4. **Property can be divided** (multiple parcels)
5. **No estate debts** requiring property sale

### Multiple Beneficiaries, One Property

**Options:**

1. **Sell and divide proceeds** (most common)
2. **Award to one beneficiary** who compensates others
3. **Create co-ownership** (rarely advisable)

**Co-ownership problems:**
- Beneficiaries must agree on all decisions
- One owner can force partition sale
- Maintenance disputes
- Financial disputes

## Selling Probate Real Estate

**See detailed guide:** [How to Sell a House in Probate California](/blog/selling-house-probate-california/)

### Step 1: Obtain Authority to Sell

**Two types of authority:**

**Full Authority (IAEA):**
- Independent Administration of Estates Act
- Executor can sell without court confirmation
- Much faster and easier
- Granted at initial hearing if will waives bond

**Limited Authority:**
- Court confirmation required for sale
- More complex process
- Takes longer
- Standard if IAEA not granted

### Step 2: Prepare Property for Sale

**Recommendations:**

**Necessary repairs:**
- Fix obvious defects
- Address safety hazards
- Complete required inspections

**Cleaning:**
- Deep clean property
- Remove personal belongings
- Clear clutter

**Staging (optional):**
- Consider professional staging
- Increases sale price 5-10% typically
- Cost: $2,000-$5,000

**Balance:** Invest enough to maximize price, but not excessive improvements.

### Step 3: Set Listing Price

**Factors:**

- Probate referee appraisal (baseline)
- Current market conditions
- Property condition
- Comparable sales
- Days on market goals
- Probate sale requirements

**If court confirmation required:**
- Minimum sale price is 90% of appraised value
- Cannot accept offer below 90% without court approval

### Step 4: List Property for Sale

**Hire real estate agent experienced in probate sales.**

**Disclosures required:**

- Property sold "as-is" in probate (in many cases)
- Estate doesn't know property history
- Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) exemption
- Natural Hazard Disclosure
- Lead paint disclosure (if pre-1978)

### Step 5: Accept Offer

**With IAEA authority:**
- Executor accepts offer
- Standard escrow process
- No court approval needed
- Close in 30-45 days typically

**Without IAEA (court confirmation required):**
- Accept initial offer
- File petition for court confirmation
- Court hearing scheduled
- Overbidding at hearing possible
- More complex process

### Court Confirmation Process

**Required without IAEA authority.**

**Process:**

1. **Accept initial offer** (minimum 90% of appraised value)
2. **File Petition** for order confirming sale
3. **Notice to beneficiaries** and interested parties
4. **Court hearing** (4-6 weeks later)
5. **Overbidding** may occur at hearing
6. **Judge confirms sale** to highest bidder
7. **Close escrow**

**Overbidding rules:**
- Opening bid is 105% of accepted offer + $1,000
- Subsequent bids increase by set increments
- Highest bidder wins

### Property Disclosures

**Required disclosures:**

- **Natural Hazard Disclosure:** Flood zone, fire hazard, earthquake fault
- **Lead Paint Disclosure:** If built before 1978
- **Death on Property:** If within past 3 years
- **Neighborhood Noise:** If applicable
- **Pest Inspection:** Typically required by lender

**Exemptions:**
- Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) not required for probate sales
- Estate doesn't provide warranty of condition

## Property Tax Issues

### Ongoing Property Taxes

**Property taxes continue** during probate.

**Executor must:**
- Pay taxes from estate funds
- Don't let taxes go delinquent
- Penalties and interest add up quickly

**Payment schedule:**
- First installment: November 1 (due December 10)
- Second installment: February 1 (due April 10)

### Property Tax Reassessment

**Death can trigger reassessment:**

**General rule:** Death triggers reassessment to current market value.

**Exceptions (Proposition 19, effective 2021):**

**Parent-child transfer exemption:**
- Principal residence: Up to $1 million in value excluded
- Other property: No exemption (will be reassessed)
- Child must file claim
- Child must use as principal residence (for residence exemption)

**Grandparent-grandchild:** Same rules if parents deceased.

**Impact:** Property taxes may increase significantly after transfer.

### Change of Ownership Form

**Required:** Within 150 days of death or 90 days of recording deed.

**File with:** County assessor.

**Preliminary Change of Ownership Report (PCOR).**

## Distributing Real Estate to Beneficiaries

### Step 1: Obtain Court Order

**After creditor period and all debts paid:**

**Executor files:**
- Petition for final distribution
- Proposed order

**Order specifies:**
- Which beneficiaries receive property
- Any conditions
- How title will be held

### Step 2: Prepare Deed

**Executor prepares deed:**

**Type:** Usually grant deed

**From:** Estate of [Decedent]
**By:** [Executor Name], Executor
**To:** [Beneficiary Names]

**Recites:** Authority under probate court order

### Step 3: Record Deed

**File with county recorder** where property located.

**Include:**
- Executed deed
- Certified copy of court order (or letters and order)
- Preliminary Change of Ownership Report
- Documentary transfer tax declaration

**Recording transfers title** to beneficiaries.

### Step 4: Transfer Insurance and Utilities

**Beneficiary should:**
- Obtain new homeowner's insurance
- Transfer utilities to their name
- Take possession of property

### Multiple Beneficiaries

**If property distributed to multiple beneficiaries:**

**Title options:**
- Joint tenancy with right of survivorship
- Tenancy in common (default)
- Community property (if married to each other)

**Usually:** Tenants in common with each owning specified percentage.

## Special Real Estate Situations

### Rental Property

**If property is rented:**

**Executor duties:**
- Collect rent
- Maintain property
- Handle tenant issues
- Enforce lease terms
- Comply with landlord-tenant law

**At sale:**
- Property sold subject to existing leases
- Buyer becomes new landlord
- Or negotiate tenant move-out

### Out-of-State Property

**Property in other states:**

**Requires ancillary probate** in that state.

**Solutions:**
- Full ancillary probate proceeding
- Simplified procedures (if available)
- Living trust avoids this (plan ahead)

### Property in Disrepair

**Severely damaged or dilapidated property:**

**Options:**
1. Repair and sell retail
2. Sell "as-is" at discount
3. Sell to investor
4. Demolish and sell land

**Analysis:** Cost of repairs vs. increase in sale price.

### Underwater Property

**Property worth less than mortgage:**

**Options:**
1. Short sale (if lender agrees)
2. Deed in lieu of foreclosure
3. Let property foreclose
4. Beneficiary assumes mortgage and takes property

**Not executor's personal liability.**

### Life Estate Properties

**If decedent held life estate:**

**Life estate ends at death.**

Property passes to remainder beneficiaries automatically (no probate).

### Properties with Environmental Issues

**Contamination, hazardous materials, etc.:**

**Executor duties:**
- Disclose to buyers

2. **Fails to maintain insurance**
3. **Someone injured** on property due to known hazard
4. **Property taxes go delinquent** (creates lien)

1. **Maintain adequate insurance** at all times
2. **Document property condition** at start
3. **Make necessary repairs** promptly
4. **Keep detailed records** of all expenses
5. **Get professional appraisals**
6. **Follow court procedures** for sales
7. **Get beneficiary consent** when possible
8. **Consult probate attorney** on major decisions
9. **Regular property inspections**
10. **Address hazards immediately**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can executor live in probate property?

Generally no, unless will specifically permits or beneficiaries consent and executor pays fair rental value. Living rent-free is self-dealing.

### How long does it take to sell probate real estate?

With IAEA authority: 30-60 days typical. Without IAEA (court confirmation): 3-6 months.

### Can beneficiaries force sale of property?

Depends on will terms and circumstances. If multiple beneficiaries can't agree, partition sale may be required.

### What if property needs major repairs?

Executor should make necessary repairs to protect value and marketability, but get court approval for very expensive repairs.

### Can executor sell property to themselves?

Generally no. This is self-dealing and voidable unless full disclosure and court approval obtained.

### What if beneficiaries disagree about selling?

Executor follows will terms. If ambiguous, executor has discretion but should seek court guidance if dispute is serious.

### Are property sale proceeds taxable?

Generally no income tax on inherited property basis step-up. Capital gains only if property appreciates after death.
