If you have been named as a successor trustee for a loved one who resided in Los Angeles County, the "geography" of your legal duties changed significantly in recent years. Whether the deceased lived in [Glendale](/locations/glendale), [Pasadena](/locations/pasadena), or the Hollywood Hills, your path to settling the estate now leads to a single destination: The [Stanley Mosk Courthouse](https://www.lacourt.org/courthouse/courthouse/smn).

As a centralized hub for one of the largest [probate](/probate) divisions in the world, the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (111 N. Hill St.) can be intimidating. Here is what every Los Angeles trustee needs to know to survive the process in 2025.

## 1. The Centralization of LA Probate

In years past, probate matters were often spread across regional courts. Today, the Los Angeles Superior Court has centralized the vast majority of probate and [trust administration](/trust-administration) petitions at the Stanley Mosk building. This means that even if you are settling a trust for a property in [Encino](/locations/encino) or [Woodland Hills](/locations/woodland-hills), any required judicial oversight—from [Heggstad Petitions](/probate) to Trustee Instructions—happens downtown.

## 2. The High Stakes of "Probate Notes"

The Stanley Mosk Probate Division is famous for its "Probate Notes." These are comments issued by court examiners who review your filings days before your hearing. In 2025, the examiners are stricter than ever. A simple missing checkmark or a slightly incorrect notice to an heir in [Burbank](/locations/burbank) can result in a "continuance," pushing your case back by three to four months.

## 3. Navigating the Electronic Filing (E-Filing) Mandate

You cannot simply walk into Stanley Mosk and hand a clerk a paper petition. The court requires 100% electronic filing through an approved service provider. For trustees in high-value areas like [Beverly Hills](/locations/beverly-hills) and [Santa Monica](/locations/santa-monica), this technical barrier makes having an experienced attorney essential. We manage the e-filing portals to ensure your documents are "court-ready" the moment they are submitted.

## 4. Coordinating with the LA County Assessor (Prop 19)

While the court handles the legal petitions, the LA County Assessor (located just a few blocks from Stanley Mosk) handles the taxes. In 2025, the Proposition 19 residency requirements are non-negotiable. If you are administering a home in [Arcadia](/locations/arcadia) or [Calabasas](/locations/calabasas), you must coordinate your court filings with the tax exclusion deadlines to prevent a massive reassessment hike for the beneficiaries.

## 5. Why Local Expertise Still Matters

Even though the court is centralized, the assets are local. Settling an estate with Silicon Beach tech equity in [Santa Monica](/locations/santa-monica) is vastly different from managing equestrian property in the [Burbank](/locations/burbank) Rancho District or a historic estate in [Pasadena](/locations/pasadena)'s Oak Knoll.

At the Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene, we bridge the gap between your local neighborhood and the downtown courthouse. We have been navigating the halls of Stanley Mosk since 2001, ensuring our clients' trusts are settled with precision, privacy, and speed.

## Trustee's Next Steps

**Consult:** If you've discovered an asset left out of a trust or are facing a beneficiary dispute, don't wait.

**Call:** [(818) 291-6217](tel:8182916217) for a confidential strategy session.
