"My brother is the executor and he's stealing from the estate. Can we remove him?"

As a Glendale probate attorney who handles executor removal cases, I know how devastating it is when an executor breaches their fiduciary duties. Whether through theft, mismanagement, self-dealing, or simply incompetence, a bad executor can destroy estate value and harm beneficiaries.

California law provides a process to remove executors who are unfit to serve, but removal requires proving specific grounds and following formal court procedures. Understanding when and how executors can be removed helps beneficiaries protect their inheritance.

This comprehensive guide explains valid grounds for removing executors in California, who can petition for removal, the removal process step-by-step, evidence needed, what happens to the executor after removal, costs and timeline, and how to protect estate assets during removal proceedings.

## When Can an Executor Be Removed?

**California Probate Code Section 8502** lists grounds for removing executors.

### Valid Grounds for Removal

**1. Waste, Embezzlement, or Mismanagement**

**Executor:**
- Steals estate assets
- Uses estate money for personal benefit
- Invests recklessly
- Allows property to deteriorate
- Fails to collect debts owed to estate
- Spends estate money unnecessarily

**Examples:**
- Executor lives in estate house rent-free
- Uses estate credit card for personal expenses
- Sells property to themselves below market value
- Gambles with estate funds
- Fails to pay property insurance

**2. Long-Continued Failure to Perform Duties**

**Executor:**
- Fails to file inventory on time
- Doesn't pay creditors
- Ignores court deadlines
- Refuses to distribute assets
- Abandons executor responsibilities
- Doesn't respond to beneficiaries or court

**Timeline matters:** Occasional delays may not warrant removal, but persistent failure does.

**3. Insolvency or Other Financial Incapacity**

**Executor:**
- Files personal bankruptcy
- Has severe financial problems
- Cannot manage own finances
- Judgments against executor personally

**Concern:** Financially troubled executor may be tempted to misuse estate assets.

**4. Gross Incompetence**

**Executor:**
- Lacks mental capacity to serve
- Demonstrates inability to handle responsibilities
- Makes repeated serious errors
- Doesn't understand fiduciary duties

**Different from simple mistakes:** Pattern of incompetence required.

**5. Commission of Fraud**

**Executor:**
- Lies to beneficiaries
- Conceals assets
- Creates fraudulent documents
- Misleads court
- Forges signatures

**Serious misconduct** requiring removal.

**6. Permanent Incapacity or Illness**

**Executor:**
- Develops dementia
- Suffers stroke or serious illness
- Becomes mentally incompetent
- Physically unable to perform duties

**Not fault-based,** but executor cannot serve.

**7. Removal in Best Interest of Estate**

**Catch-all provision** for circumstances not fitting other categories.

**Examples:**
- Serious conflict with beneficiaries prevents effective administration
- Executor's actions causing estate to lose money
- Circumstances make continued service detrimental

**Court has discretion** to determine what serves estate's best interest.

**8. Failure to Meet Statutory Requirements**

**Executor:**
- Never qualified (didn't take oath, didn't obtain letters)
- Moved out of state without approval
- Lost bond coverage
- Convicted of crime affecting trustworthiness

### What Is NOT Grounds for Removal

**Insufficient grounds:**

- Beneficiaries simply don't like executor
- Personality conflicts without financial harm
- Executor makes decisions beneficiaries disagree with (if reasonable)
- Executor takes allowed compensation
- Isolated minor errors
- Delay alone (without pattern of neglect)

**Disagreement ≠ Grounds for removal**

## Who Can Petition to Remove an Executor?

**California Probate Code Section 8500**

### Interested Persons Who Can File

**1. Beneficiaries Named in Will**
- Anyone entitled to inherit under will
- Even if receiving small share

**2. Heirs at Law**
- People who would inherit if no will
- Even if will leaves them nothing

**3. Creditors of Estate**
- If executor's mismanagement threatens creditor payment

**4. Other Executors (Co-Executors)**
- Can seek removal of problematic co-executor

**5. Public Administrator**
- If circumstances warrant

### Standing Requirement

**Must show:** You have financial interest affected by executor's actions.

**No standing:**

## The Removal Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Document Executor Misconduct

**Before filing petition, gather evidence:**

### Step 2: Consider Informal Resolution

**Before court action:**

3. Propose executor voluntarily resign
4. Mediate dispute

**Benefits of resolving without litigation:**

- Avoids further estate depletion from legal fees

**But:** If misconduct is serious or executor refuses to cooperate, court action necessary.

### Step 3: File Petition for Removal

**Petition must include:**
- Your relationship to estate
- Your standing to petition
- Grounds for removal (specific facts)

**File with:** Probate court handling estate

**Filing fee:** $435

### Step 4: Request Temporary Suspension

**California Probate Code Section 8503**

**If immediate danger to estate:**

**Can request:**
