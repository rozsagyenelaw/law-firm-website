# Trustee Compensation and Taxes in California: Complete Fee Guide

One of the most common questions trustees ask is: "How much can I pay myself?" California law provides clear guidance on trustee compensation, but the tax implications are often misunderstood. This guide covers statutory fees, reasonable compensation standards, how fees are taxed, and best practices for taking trustee compensation.

## California Trustee Compensation Law

### Statutory Fee Schedule

**California Probate Code §15681** provides default compensation:

**Annual compensation:**

| Trust Principal | Annual Fee |
|----------------|------------|
| First $1 million | 1% |
| Next $9 million | 0.5% |
| Over $10 million | Reasonable amount |

**Plus additional for:**
- Extraordinary services
- Income collected
- Termination/distribution

**Example:**
- Trust worth $2,000,000
- Annual fee = ($1M × 1%) + ($1M × 0.5%) = $10,000 + $5,000 = **$15,000/year**

### When Statutory Fees Apply

**Default rule:**
Statutory fees apply ONLY if trust document is silent.

**Trust document controls:**
If trust specifies compensation, that amount applies (can be more or less than statutory).

**Example provisions:**
- "Trustee shall receive $10,000 per year"
- "Trustee shall receive reasonable compensation"
- "Trustee shall serve without compensation"
- "Trustee shall receive statutory fees under California law"

### Reasonable Compensation

**If trust says "reasonable":**
Factors courts consider:
- Time spent on trust matters
- Complexity of trust
- Trustee's skill and experience
- Results achieved
- Customary fees in area
- Size of trust estate

**Typical range:** 0.5% - 2% of principal annually

### Professional vs. Family Trustees

**Professional trustees:**
- Banks: 1% - 2% annually
- Trust companies: 0.75% - 1.5%
- Professional fiduciaries: 1% - 2%
- May charge minimums ($5,000-$10,000/year)

**Family trustees:**
- Often take lower fees
- May waive compensation entirely
- Can take statutory amount
- Should document decision

### Extraordinary Services

**Beyond routine administration:**
- Selling business interests
- Defending litigation
- Managing complex investments
- Handling tax audits
- Contested beneficiary disputes

**Additional reasonable compensation** beyond annual fee

**Example:**
Annual fee: $15,000
Plus extraordinary services (litigation): $25,000
**Total compensation: $40,000**

## How to Take Trustee Compensation

### 1. Review Trust Document

**First step:**
Check if trust specifies compensation method.

**Common provisions:**
- Fixed dollar amount
- Percentage of assets
- Hourly rate
- "Reasonable" compensation
- No compensation

### 2. Determine Amount

**Calculate based on:**
- Trust document terms, OR
- Statutory formula if trust silent, OR
- Reasonable amount

### 3. Document Decision

**Keep records showing:**
- How amount calculated
- Time spent (if hourly)
- Services provided
- Date compensation taken
- Trust principal value used

### 4. Account to Beneficiaries

**Include in trust accounting:**
- Amount of compensation
- Period covered
- Calculation method
- Services provided

**Transparency prevents disputes.**

### 5. Pay From Trust Account

**Never:**
- Mix with personal funds
- Take from personal account
- "Reimburse yourself" improperly

**Always:**
- Pay from trust checking account
- By check made out to yourself as trustee
- Keep copies

## Tax Treatment of Trustee Fees

### Federal Income Tax

**Trustee fees are taxable income (ordinary income)**

**Reported on:**
- Your personal Form 1040
- Schedule C (if you're professional trustee)
- Line 8 "Other Income" (if family trustee)

**Not reported on:**
- W-2 (you're not an employee)
- Form 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC (issued to you by trust)

### Self-Employment Tax

**Professional trustees:**
- Subject to self-employment tax (15.3%)
- Report on Schedule SE
- Fees are business income

**Family trustees (occasional):**
- Generally NOT subject to self-employment tax
- Fees are "other income"
- One-time or infrequent service

**Example:**
Professional trustee receives $50,000:
- Income tax: ~$12,000 (24% bracket)
- Self-employment tax: ~$7,650 (15.3%)
- **Total tax: ~$19,650**

### Trust Tax Deduction

**Trust deducts fees paid:**
- Form 1041, Line 10
- Reduces trust taxable income
- Shifts tax from trust to trustee

**Why this matters:**
- Trust tax rates reach 37% at $15,200
- Trustee may be in lower bracket
- Net tax savings to family

### Form 1099-NEC

**Trust must issue if:**
- Fees paid to non-family trustee
- Total fees $600 or more in year
- Trustee is providing services in trade/business

**When NOT required:**
- Family member trustee
- Corporate trustee (files own returns)
- Fees under $600

**Form details:**
- File by January 31
- Copy to trustee
- Copy to IRS
- Use trust EIN as payer

### California Tax

**Trustee fees taxable:**
- Reported on Form 540 (personal return)
- Same character as federal (ordinary income)
- Subject to CA rates (up to 13.3%)

### Estimated Taxes

**If fees substantial:**
- Make quarterly estimated payments
- Federal Form 1040-ES
- California Form 540-ES

**Safe harbor:** Pay 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150K)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Taking Compensation

**Problem:**
- Trustees work for free
- Don't realize they can be paid
- Feel guilty taking fees

**Why you should:**
- It's legal and appropriate
- Time has value
- Reduces trust tax (shifts to lower bracket)

**Exception:** If relationship close and estate small, waiving may be appropriate.

### 2. Taking Too Much

**Problem:**
- Exceeds reasonable amount
- No documentation
- Beneficiaries challenge

**Consequences:**
- Court may surcharge
- Require repayment
- Remove trustee

**Solution:** Stay within statutory or clearly document reasonableness.

### 3. Not Reporting as Income

**Problem:**
- Trustee doesn't report fees on tax return
- Treats as tax-free distribution

**Consequence:**
- IRS catches via Form 1099 or audit
- Back taxes plus penalties and interest

**Solution:** Always report fees as ordinary income.

### 4. Poor Documentation

**Problem:**
- No records of time spent
- Can't justify fees taken
- Beneficiaries suspicious

**Solution:**
- Keep time logs
- Maintain detailed records
- Include in accountings

### 5. Improper Payment Method

**Problem:**
- Write personal check then reimburse from trust
- Transfer to personal account without documentation
- Commingle funds

**Solution:**
- Always pay from trust account
- Clear check memo ("trustee fee Q1 2024")
- Keep copies

### 6. Ignoring Self-Employment Tax

**Problem:**
- Professional trustee doesn't pay SE tax
- Thinks fees are "passive income"

**Consequence:**
- IRS assesses SE tax plus penalties

**Solution:** File Schedule SE if you're professional fiduciary.

## Special Situations

### Multiple Trustees

**Co-trustees:**
- Split fees as agreed
- Or according to work performed
- Document arrangement

**Example:**
- Two co-trustees
- Total statutory fee: $20,000
- Each takes $10,000

### Corporate Trustees

**Banks and trust companies:**
- Higher fees (1-2% annually)
- Professional management
- Not subject to individual income tax (corporate returns)

### Successor Trustees

**Taking over mid-administration:**
- Entitled to fees from date of appointment
- Not fees for prior trustee's work
- Pro-rate annual fee

### Declining Compensation

**Can waive fees:**
- Document waiver in writing
- Note in trust accounting
- Can change mind later (within reason)

**Tax impact of waiver:**
- No income if not taken
- Can't take deduction for "gift" of services

### Late Payment

**Can pay fees for prior years:**
- Deduct on Form 1041 year paid (not accrued)
- Report on Form 1040 year received
- Document why delayed

## Payment Best Practices

### 1. Take Compensation Regularly

**Recommended:**
- Quarterly payments
- Easier for trust budget
- Smooths tax impact
- Demonstrates ongoing service

**Example:**
- Annual fee $20,000
- Take $5,000 per quarter

### 2. Keep Detailed Time Records

**Log:**
- Date
- Service performed
- Time spent
- Result

**Example entry:**
"1/15/24 - Reviewed estate appraisals, spoke with appraiser about valuation methods, prepared summary for beneficiaries - 3.5 hours"

### 3. Be Transparent

**Include in accounting:**
- Total fees taken
- Period covered
- Calculation method
- Comparison to statutory (if applicable)

### 4. Consider Beneficiary Relations

**Family dynamics:**
- Some families expect trustee to waive
- Others expect professional-level fees
- Communicate early about compensation

### 5. Get Tax Help

**Consult CPA about:**
- Estimated tax payments
- Self-employment tax
- Proper reporting

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much can a trustee charge in California?

California Probate Code Section 15681 provides statutory fees of 1% annually on the first $1 million of trust assets and 0.5% on the next $9 million. However, if the trust document specifies compensation, those terms control. Professional trustees typically charge 1-2% annually, while family trustees may take lower fees or waive compensation entirely. Reasonable compensation also depends on complexity, time spent, and services provided.

### Are trustee fees taxable income in California?

Yes, trustee fees are taxable ordinary income reported on your personal tax return. Professional trustees must also pay self-employment tax at 15.3% on fees received. Family trustees who serve occasionally typically do not pay self-employment tax but must still report fees as ordinary income. The trust can deduct the fees paid, which shifts tax burden from the high-tax trust to the potentially lower-bracket trustee.

### Do I need to issue a 1099 for trustee compensation?

The trust must issue Form 1099-NEC to non-family trustees if total fees are $600 or more in a year and the trustee provides services in their trade or business. Family member trustees serving in a personal capacity generally do not require a 1099. Corporate trustees file their own returns and handle their own tax reporting. The form must be filed by January 31st using the trust's EIN as payer.

### Can a trustee pay themselves without beneficiary approval?

Yes, trustees can take compensation authorized by the trust document or statutory fees without beneficiary approval. However, trustees must account for all compensation taken in their accountings to beneficiaries. Taking excessive or unreasonable fees can be challenged by beneficiaries and may constitute breach of fiduciary duty. Best practice is to communicate compensation decisions transparently and keep detailed records justifying the amount taken.

### What happens if a trustee takes excessive compensation?

Beneficiaries can petition the court to surcharge the trustee for excessive compensation, requiring them to repay the excess from personal funds. The court may also remove the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty. To avoid disputes, trustees should stay within statutory limits or clearly document why higher fees are reasonable based on extraordinary services, complexity, time spent, and results achieved.
