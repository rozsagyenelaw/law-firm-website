**LOOKING FOR A GLENDALE PROBATE ATTORNEY?** I'm Rozsa Gyene, a California probate attorney with 25+ years of experience serving Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena, and Los Angeles County. I handle every aspect of probate — from filing the petition to final distribution — so you can focus on your family. Call (818) 291-6217 for a free consultation.

When a Glendale resident passes away, their family often faces an overwhelming legal process. [California probate](/blog/california-probate-complete-guide-2025) involves court filings, strict deadlines, creditor notifications, and complex paperwork that can take 12-18 months to complete.

As a Glendale probate attorney with over 25 years of experience, I've guided hundreds of local families through this difficult process. My office is right here in Glendale at 450 N Brand Blvd, and I understand the unique needs of our community.

Let me tell you exactly how I help Glendale families through California probate.

## Why Glendale Families Need Probate Help

Glendale has some of the highest property values in Los Angeles County. The median home price exceeds $1 million, which means probate costs for Glendale families are substantial:

- **$1 million estate:** $46,000 in statutory probate fees
- **$1.5 million estate:** $56,000 in statutory probate fees
- **$2 million estate:** $66,000 in statutory probate fees

With this much at stake, you need an experienced attorney who knows how to navigate the system efficiently and protect your family's interests.

## My Probate Services for Glendale Families

### Full-Service Probate Representation

I handle every aspect of probate from start to finish:

- Petition for Probate preparation and filing
- All court appearances at Stanley Mosk Courthouse
- Creditor notification and claims management
- Inventory and appraisal coordination
- Estate tax returns and final income taxes
- Real estate sales (if needed)
- Final accounting and distribution

### Executor Guidance and Support

Being named executor is a significant responsibility. You have legal duties to the estate and beneficiaries, and mistakes can result in personal liability. I guide executors through every decision, protect them from liability, and handle the legal complexity so they can fulfill their duties with confidence.

### Beneficiary Representation

If you're a beneficiary waiting for your inheritance, you have rights. I help beneficiaries:

- Understand the probate process
- Get updates on estate administration
- Review accountings and fee requests
- Take action if the executor isn't fulfilling their duties

### Contested Probate and Disputes

When families disagree about a will, executor actions, or asset distribution, I provide experienced litigation support. I've handled:

- Will contests
- Executor removal proceedings
- Beneficiary disputes
- Breach of fiduciary duty claims

Throughout my 25+ year career, I've successfully resolved countless estate disputes while minimizing family conflict.

## Real Situations I've Helped Glendale Families Navigate

### The Overwhelmed Executor

A Glendale woman was named executor of her mother's estate. She had no legal background and was already grieving. The estate included a home, bank accounts, and investment accounts — nothing unusual, but she had no idea where to start.

I took over the legal process completely. She attended no court hearings. She signed documents I prepared. Fourteen months later, the estate was closed and assets distributed. She told me, "I couldn't have done this without you."

### The Family Dispute

Three siblings couldn't agree on anything after their father died. One wanted to sell the family home immediately; another wanted to keep it; the third suspected the executor sibling was mismanaging the estate.

As a neutral attorney representing the estate (not any individual), I helped navigate the conflict. We sold the home at fair market value, distributed proceeds equally, and closed the estate without litigation. The family relationships survived.

### The Out-of-State Heir

A client living in New York inherited his uncle's Glendale condo. He couldn't travel to California for court hearings, didn't know any local attorneys, and had no idea how California probate worked.

I handled everything remotely. He signed documents electronically, I appeared at all hearings, and we sold the condo and wired him the proceeds without him ever setting foot in California.

## How the Probate Process Works in Glendale

While all California probate cases are filed at Stanley Mosk Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, I make the process convenient for Glendale families.

### Step 1: Free Consultation at My Glendale Office

We meet at my office at 450 N Brand Blvd (or by phone/video if you prefer). I'll review your situation, explain the probate process, and answer all your questions. No obligation, no pressure.

### Step 2: File the Petition for Probate

I prepare and file the Petition for Probate at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. This includes gathering information about assets, heirs, beneficiaries, and the proposed executor.

### Step 3: Handle All Court Proceedings

I attend all court hearings on your behalf. You don't need to take time off work or navigate the downtown LA courthouse. I'll keep you informed of everything that happens.

### Step 4: Manage Estate Administration

During the 12-18 month process, I handle:

- Notifying creditors and reviewing claims
- Preparing inventory and appraisal
- Managing estate assets
- Selling real estate if necessary
- Filing tax returns
- Keeping detailed records

### Step 5: Final Distribution

When everything is complete, I prepare the final accounting, obtain court approval, and guide you through distributing assets to beneficiaries. Then we close the estate properly and you're done.

## Understanding Probate Costs in Glendale

California law sets statutory fees for probate attorneys based on the estate's gross value. Here's what you can expect:

### Statutory Fee Schedule

- 4% of the first $100,000
- 3% of the next $100,000
- 2% of the next $800,000
- 1% of the next $9,000,000
- 0.5% of amounts above $10,000,000

### Real Glendale Estate Examples

**Example 1: Glendale Home + Savings**

- Home valued at: $1,200,000
- Bank/investment accounts: $300,000
- Total gross estate: $1,500,000
- Attorney statutory fee: $28,000
- Executor statutory fee: $28,000
- Total statutory fees: $56,000

**Example 2: Modest Glendale Estate**

- Condo valued at: $650,000
- Bank accounts: $100,000
- Total gross estate: $750,000
- Attorney statutory fee: $18,500
- Executor statutory fee: $18,500
- Total statutory fees: $37,000

These fees are paid from the estate, not out of your pocket. I'll explain all costs clearly during your free consultation.

### 25+ Years of Experience

I've been practicing California probate law since 1999. I've handled hundreds of probate cases at Stanley Mosk Courthouse and know the judges, procedures, and local rules inside and out.

### Stanley Mosk Courthouse Expertise

All Los Angeles County probate cases are filed at Stanley Mosk Courthouse in downtown LA. I appear there regularly and know how to move cases efficiently through the system.

### Community Understanding

Glendale is a diverse community with Armenian, Latino, Middle Eastern, and other cultural traditions. I understand and respect the different ways families approach estate matters and mourning.

## Frequently Asked Questions from Glendale Clients

### Do I need a probate attorney in Glendale?

While you can legally represent yourself in California probate, most people find the process overwhelming. Between strict deadlines, complex paperwork, and personal liability risks, having an experienced attorney protects you and makes the process much smoother.

### How long does probate take in Los Angeles County?

Most probate cases take 12-18 months from start to finish. Complex estates with litigation, tax issues, or real estate sales can take 2-3 years or longer.

### What if my loved one had a will?

Having a will makes probate smoother because it names an executor and specifies who gets what. But the will must still go through probate to be validated and executed. Only a living trust avoids probate entirely.

### What if my loved one didn't have a will?

When someone dies without a will (intestate), California's intestate succession laws determine who inherits. The process is similar to probate with a will, but the court appoints an administrator rather than an executor.

### Can you help if I live out of state?

Yes. Many of my clients live outside California. I can handle most communication by phone, email, and video conference. You'll need to sign some documents (which I can send electronically), but you typically don't need to travel to California.

### What if the family is fighting?

Family disputes are unfortunately common in probate. I help families navigate disagreements, mediate when possible, and litigate when necessary. My goal is always to resolve conflicts efficiently while minimizing damage to family relationships.

### How much do you charge?

California law sets statutory probate fees based on the estate's value. I'll explain the exact fees for your case during your free consultation. The fees are paid from the estate, not out of your pocket.

### Do you offer a free consultation?

Yes. I offer a free initial consultation where we'll discuss your situation, review any documents you have, and I'll explain your options. No obligation, no pressure.

## Beyond Probate: Other Ways I Help Glendale Families

### Estate Planning

The best way to help your family avoid probate is to create a living trust. My living trust packages start at just **$575 (single) / $675 (married couples)** and include:

- Complete revocable living trust
- Pour-over will
- Financial power of attorney
- Healthcare power of attorney
- HIPAA authorization
- Deed transfer for your primary residence

### Trust Administration

If your loved one had a trust, I guide successor trustees through the administration process. Trust administration avoids court involvement and typically takes just 4-8 weeks.

### Trust Litigation

When trustees aren't fulfilling their duties or beneficiaries' rights are being violated, I represent clients in trust disputes and litigation.

### Conservatorships

I help families establish conservatorships for elderly or incapacitated loved ones who need protection.
