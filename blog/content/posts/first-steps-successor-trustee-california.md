Someone you care about has passed away, and you've just learned you're the successor trustee of their living trust. You're grieving, and now you have legal responsibilities.

Take a breath. You don't have to do everything at once. Here are your first steps, in order of priority.

## The First 24-48 Hours

### Step 1: Locate the Trust Document

Before you can do anything, you need the trust itself.

**Where to look:**

- Deceased's home (safe, filing cabinet, desk)
- Safe deposit box
- Attorney who prepared the trust
- Family members who may have copies
- Deceased's financial advisor

**What you need:**

- Original trust document
- ALL amendments (labeled "First Amendment," "Second Amendment," etc.)
- Any trust restatement

**Important:** If you can only find a copy, that's okay to start. But try to locate the original.

### Step 2: Read the Trust Carefully

Don't assume you know what the trust says. Read it completely, including:

- Who are the beneficiaries?
- What does each beneficiary receive?
- Are there any conditions on distributions?
- Are there special provisions for minors or disabled beneficiaries?
- Who are the alternate/backup trustees?
- What powers do you have as trustee?
- Are there any restrictions on your authority?
- What does it say about trustee compensation?

Take notes. Highlight important sections. You'll refer to this document constantly.

### Step 3: Secure the Property

Protect the deceased's assets from loss, theft, or damage:

**Home:**

- Lock all doors and windows
- Consider changing locks (especially if keys are unaccounted for)
- Set the alarm if there is one
- Don't leave the home unattended for extended periods
- Tell neighbors the situation (they can watch for problems)

**Valuables:**

- Secure jewelry, cash, and collectibles
- Move extremely valuable items to a safe location
- Don't let anyone "borrow" items

**Mail:**

- Collect mail daily
- Watch for bills, account statements, and legal notices

**Vehicles:**

- Secure all vehicles
- Locate keys and titles

### Step 4: Don't Distribute Anything Yet

This is crucial: Do NOT give assets to beneficiaries yet.

Even if a beneficiary says "Mom wanted me to have the jewelry," wait. You need to:

- Verify what the trust actually says
- Complete the required legal steps
- Wait for the 120-day contest period
- Ensure debts and taxes are paid first

Premature distributions can make you personally liable.

## The First Week

### Step 5: Get Death Certificates

You'll need certified death certificates for almost everything. Order 10-15 copies from:

- The funeral home (easiest)
- County Registrar's office
- California Department of Public Health

**Why so many?** Banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and government agencies each need their own original certified copy. Running out means delays.

### Step 6: Contact an Attorney

Unless the trust is extremely simple (only cash, one beneficiary, no real estate), consult an estate planning attorney.

**Why hire an attorney?**

- Ensures you don't miss deadlines
- Prepares required legal notices
- Handles real estate transfers
- Advises on tax obligations
- Protects you from personal liability
- Fees are paid from trust assets (not your pocket)

**First consultation questions:**

- What are my immediate obligations?
- What's the timeline for this trust?
- What do you charge for trust administration?
- What mistakes should I avoid?

### Step 7: Notify Key People

Make these calls and notifications:

**Financial institutions:**

- Banks where deceased had accounts
- Investment/brokerage firms
- Retirement account custodians

Don't ask to withdraw funds yet—just notify them of the death and that you're the successor trustee. Ask what they need from you.

**Insurance companies:**

- Life insurance policies (to file claims)
- Homeowner's/renter's insurance (to maintain coverage)
- Auto insurance (to maintain coverage)
- Health insurance (to cancel and handle final claims)

**Government:**

- Social Security Administration (to stop benefits and report death)
- Medicare (if applicable)
- Pension administrators
- Veterans Affairs (if applicable)

**Employers:**

- Deceased's employer (if recently employed)
- Ask about final paycheck, benefits, life insurance

### Step 8: Pay Essential Bills Only

You need to keep assets protected, so pay:

✓ Mortgage payments
✓ Property taxes
✓ Homeowner's insurance
✓ Utility bills
✓ Car insurance
✓ Storage unit fees
✓ Security system

Pay from the deceased's accounts if possible, or track reimbursement if you pay personally.

**Don't pay yet:**

- Credit cards (unless secured debt)
- Medical bills (wait until you assess all debts)
- Personal loans
- Other unsecured debts

You'll address these later after inventorying all obligations.

## The First Month

### Step 9: Get an EIN for the Trust

The trust needs its own tax identification number (EIN) now that the trustor has died.

**How to get it:**

- Online at IRS.gov (fastest—takes 10 minutes)
- By mail using Form SS-4

**Why you need it:**

- To open a trust bank account
- For trust tax returns
- Financial institutions will require it

### Step 10: Open a Trust Bank Account

Open a checking account in the trust's name:

**Account title:** "[Name] Trust, [Your Name], Trustee"

**What you'll need:**

- Trust document (or certification)
- Death certificate
- Your ID
- EIN for the trust

**Use this account for:**

- All trust income
- All trust expenses
- Keeping trust funds separate from your personal funds

### Step 11: Send Required Notices

**CRITICAL DEADLINE: 60 days from death (or becoming trustee)**

California Probate Code §16061.7 requires you to notify:

- All beneficiaries named in the trust
- All legal heirs (people who would inherit if there were no trust)

**The notice must include:**

- Trust identification
- Your name and contact information
- That the trust is now irrevocable
- Their right to request trust terms
- The 120-day period to contest the trust

**How to send:**

- Certified mail, return receipt requested (keeps proof)
- Keep copies of everything

This deadline is strict. Missing it extends the time beneficiaries can contest the trust.

### Step 12: Create an Asset Inventory

List everything the trust owns:

| Asset Type | Description | Estimated Value |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Real estate | 123 Main St, Glendale | $850,000 |
| Bank accounts | Chase checking | $45,000 |
| Investments | Fidelity brokerage | $200,000 |
| Retirement | IRA at Vanguard | $150,000 |
| Life insurance | MetLife policy | $100,000 |
| Vehicles | 2020 Toyota Camry | $22,000 |
| Personal property | Jewelry, furniture | $15,000 |

Also list debts:

- Mortgages
- Credit cards
- Medical bills
- Loans
- Taxes owed

This inventory guides everything you do next.

## Common First-Month Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Distributing assets early

Wait until the 120-day contest period expires and all debts/taxes are paid.

### Mistake 2: Missing the 60-day notice deadline

Mark your calendar. Send notices by certified mail with proof.

### Mistake 3: Using deceased's Social Security number

Get an EIN for the trust and use that going forward.

### Mistake 4: Mixing trust funds with personal funds

Open a separate trust account. Never commingle.

### Mistake 5: Making decisions without reading the trust

The trust is your instruction manual. Read it thoroughly.

### Mistake 6: Throwing away documents

Keep everything. You may need it for tax purposes or beneficiary questions.

### Mistake 7: Going it alone

Professional guidance pays for itself in avoided mistakes.
