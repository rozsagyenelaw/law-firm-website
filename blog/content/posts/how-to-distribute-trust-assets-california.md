You've administered the trust, paid the debts, filed the tax returns, and waited for the contest period to expire. Now it's time for the final step: actually distributing assets to beneficiaries.

But how do you transfer a house? Move investment accounts? Divide personal property fairly? This guide covers the mechanics of distributing different types of trust assets in California.

## Before You Distribute: Final Checklist

Before making any final distributions, confirm:

☐ **120-day contest period has expired**
Calculate 120 days from when you sent the statutory notices. Don't distribute until this deadline passes.

☐ **All debts are paid**
Outstanding creditors can pursue beneficiaries if you distribute before paying valid debts.

☐ **Taxes are handled**
File all required returns and pay taxes due—or reserve sufficient funds.

☐ **Trust terms are clear**
Understand exactly what each beneficiary should receive.

☐ **Funds are reserved**
Keep enough for final administration expenses and unexpected claims.

## Distributing Real Estate

### Option 1: Transfer to One Beneficiary

If the trust gives real estate to a single beneficiary:

**Step 1: Prepare the Trustee's Deed**

A trustee's deed (also called a grant deed from trustee) transfers title from the trust to the beneficiary.

**The deed must include:**

- Legal description of the property
- Trust name and date
- Your name as trustee
- Beneficiary's name
- Statement that you're acting as trustee
- Your signature (notarized)

**Step 2: Complete the Preliminary Change of Ownership Report (PCOR)**

This California form accompanies the deed and provides information for property tax purposes.

**Step 3: Record the Deed**

File the deed with the County Recorder's office where the property is located.

**Recording fees:** Approximately $25-$75 plus $3 per page.

**Step 4: Provide Documents to Beneficiary**

Give the beneficiary:

- Copy of recorded deed
- Copy of title insurance (if available)
- Property tax information
- Any relevant disclosures

### Option 2: Transfer to Multiple Beneficiaries

If multiple beneficiaries receive the property together:

**Step 1: Determine How They'll Hold Title**

Options include:

- Tenants in common (each owns a percentage)
- Joint tenants with right of survivorship
- Community property (if married couple)

**Step 2: Prepare Deed to All Beneficiaries**

The deed shows all beneficiaries as grantees with their chosen form of ownership.

**Step 3: Record and Distribute**

Same process as above.

### Option 3: Sell the Property

If the trust requires selling and distributing proceeds:

**Step 1: List the Property**

Work with a real estate agent to list and sell the property.

**Step 2: Clear Title**

Ensure title is clear and can be transferred to buyers.

**Step 3: Close Escrow**

Sign trustee's deed to buyers at closing.

**Step 4: Distribute Proceeds**

Divide sale proceeds according to trust terms.

**Timeline for real estate:**

- Transfer to beneficiary: 2-4 weeks
- Sale of property: 3-6 months

### Proposition 19 Considerations

If transferring to children/grandchildren, consider Proposition 19:

- Parent-child exclusion requires the recipient to use property as primary residence within one year
- Only the first $1 million in increased value is excluded from reassessment
- Must file claim within 3 years

Consult with an attorney about property tax implications before transferring.

## Distributing Cash and Bank Accounts

Cash is the simplest asset to distribute.

### Step 1: Calculate Each Beneficiary's Share

Based on trust terms, determine exact amounts:

**Example:**
- Trust says: "Divide equally among my three children"
- Trust bank account balance: $150,000
- Each child receives: $50,000

### Step 2: Consider Reserves

Before distributing everything, hold back funds for:

- Final trust tax return (Form 1041)
- Any remaining administration expenses
- Potential unexpected claims

**A common approach:** Distribute 90% now, hold 10% until final accounting complete.

### Step 3: Distribute Funds

**Options:**

- Write checks from trust account
- Wire transfers
- Cashier's checks

**Make checks payable to:** The beneficiary's legal name

**Document everything:** Keep copies of all checks and wire confirmations.

### Step 4: Get Receipts

Have each beneficiary sign a receipt acknowledging:

- Amount received
- Date received
- That it represents their distribution from the trust

### Step 5: Close the Account

After final distributions, close the trust bank account.

## Distributing Investment Accounts

Transferring investment accounts requires coordination with the financial institution.

### Option 1: Transfer In-Kind

Transfer the actual investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to the beneficiary's account.

**Process:**

1. Contact the brokerage/custodian
2. Request trust distribution paperwork
3. Complete transfer forms
4. Beneficiary opens account (if needed)
5. Investments transfer to beneficiary's account

**Advantages:**

- No immediate tax consequences
- Beneficiary keeps the investments
- Stepped-up basis transfers with the assets

**Timeline:** 1-3 weeks typically

### Option 2: Liquidate and Distribute Cash

Sell all investments and distribute cash.

**Process:**

1. Sell all holdings in the trust account
2. Wait for trades to settle (2 business days)
3. Distribute cash proceeds to beneficiaries

**Considerations:**

- Capital gains tax if sold above stepped-up basis
- Easier to divide equally among beneficiaries
- Beneficiaries can reinvest as they choose

### Cost Basis Documentation

**Critical:** Provide beneficiaries with date-of-death values (stepped-up basis) for all investments they receive. They'll need this information when they eventually sell.

**Create a statement showing:**

| Investment | Shares | Date of Death Value | Cost Basis per Share |
|------------|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Apple Stock | 100 | $18,000 | $180.00 |
| Vanguard Fund | 500 | $75,000 | $150.00 |

## Distributing Retirement Accounts

Retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s) have special rules.

### Check the Beneficiary Designation

Retirement accounts pass by beneficiary designation—NOT through the trust (usually).

**If individuals are named as beneficiaries:**
The accounts pass directly to them outside the trust. The trustee's role is limited.

**If the trust is named as beneficiary:**
The accounts pass to the trust and must be distributed according to trust terms.

### Distribution Rules Depend on Beneficiary Type

**Surviving spouse:**

- Can roll over to their own IRA
- Most flexibility

**Non-spouse beneficiary (under SECURE Act):**

- Generally must withdraw all funds within 10 years
- Exceptions for certain "eligible designated beneficiaries"

**Trust as beneficiary:**

- Complex rules apply
- May require distribution within 10 years
- Consult tax advisor

### Tax Implications

Retirement account distributions are generally taxable income to the recipient. The trustee doesn't withhold taxes—the beneficiary is responsible.

## Distributing Personal Property

Personal property (furniture, jewelry, art, collectibles, etc.) can be emotionally charged and logistically challenging.

### If Trust Specifies Distribution

Follow the trust terms:

- "My diamond ring to my daughter Sarah"
- "My art collection to be divided equally among my children"

### If Trust Says "Divide Equally" or Is Silent

**Option 1: Beneficiaries Choose**

Let beneficiaries take turns selecting items. Use a fair method:

- Draw numbers for selection order
- Alternate who picks first in each round
- Document who took what

**Option 2: Appraisal and Equalization**

Have valuable items appraised. Beneficiaries who receive more valuable items compensate others with cash.

**Option 3: Sell Everything**

Sell personal property (estate sale, auction) and divide proceeds.

### Best Practices for Personal Property

**Inventory everything:** Create a detailed list with photographs.

**Identify valuable items:** Get appraisals for jewelry, art, antiques, and collectibles.

**Communicate early:** Ask beneficiaries what they want before starting distribution.

**Document distribution:** Keep a written record of who received what.

**Get receipts:** Have beneficiaries sign for items received.

**Handle disputes fairly:** If beneficiaries can't agree, consider mediation or selling the disputed item.

### Sentimental vs. Monetary Value

Personal property often creates more conflict than valuable assets because of emotional attachments.

**Tips:**

- Acknowledge that items have sentimental value
- Give beneficiaries time to express preferences
- Consider fair processes over strict monetary splits
- A few hundred dollars in "unfairness" isn't worth a family fight

## Distributing Vehicles

**Step 1: Locate the Title**

Find the certificate of title (pink slip) for each vehicle.

**Step 2: Complete the Title Transfer**

On the title, complete:

- Release of ownership (trustee signs as seller)
- Odometer disclosure
- Beneficiary information (as buyer)

**Step 3: Beneficiary Visits DMV**

The beneficiary takes to the DMV:

- Completed title
- Death certificate
- Trust certification
- Their identification
- Payment for registration fees

**Step 4: Registration in Beneficiary's Name**

The DMV issues new registration and title in the beneficiary's name.

**Note:** Some transfers between family members may be exempt from use tax. Check current DMV rules.

## Handling Unequal Distributions

Not every beneficiary receives the same thing—or the same value.

### When the Trust Requires Unequal Distribution

If the trust specifies unequal shares (e.g., 50% to daughter, 25% to each son), follow those terms exactly. You're not authorized to change them.

### When Specific Gifts Create Inequality

If specific gifts result in unequal values:

**Example:**
Trust says: House to Mary, investments to John, cash to Tom

- House: $800,000
- Investments: $400,000
- Cash: $300,000

If this is what the trust says, that's what happens—even though it's unequal.

### When Trust Requires Equal Distribution

If the trust says "divide equally," calculate total value and ensure each beneficiary receives an equal share.

**May require:**

- Selling assets
- One beneficiary buying out others
- Balancing high-value assets with cash

## Final Steps After Distribution

### Obtain Receipts and Releases

Have each beneficiary sign:

- Receipt listing everything they received
- Release acknowledging distribution is complete
- Waiver of claims against trustee (optional but recommended)

### Prepare Final Accounting

Create a report showing:

- All assets at start of administration
- All income received
- All expenses paid
- All distributions made
- Final balance (should be zero or near zero)

Provide to all beneficiaries.

### File Final Tax Return

File the trust's final Form 1041/541 reporting:

- Final trust income
- Final distributions to beneficiaries
- Trust termination

### Retain Records

Keep all records for at least 5-7 years:

- Distribution receipts
- Bank statements
- Tax returns
- Correspondence
- Accounting records

## Common Distribution Mistakes

**Distributing before contest period expires:** Wait the full 120 days.

**Not reserving for taxes:** Keep funds for final returns.

**Forgetting small accounts:** Close all accounts, even small ones.

**Not documenting basis:** Beneficiaries need stepped-up basis information.

**Ignoring unhappy beneficiaries:** Address concerns before they escalate.

**Disposing of "worthless" items:** Let beneficiaries decide what has value to them.
