"I've been named executor of my mother's will. How do I access her bank accounts and manage her property?"

As a Glendale probate attorney, I hear this question frequently from newly appointed executors who are surprised to learn that being named in a will doesn't automatically give them authority. The key to accessing estate assets and acting on behalf of the estate is obtaining **Letters Testamentary** from the probate court.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain what Letters Testamentary are, how to obtain them, what powers they grant, how to use them effectively, their limitations, and important considerations for California executors.

## What Are Letters Testamentary?

**Letters Testamentary** are official court documents that prove your legal authority to act as executor of an estate.

**Think of them as:** Your "credentials" or "badge of authority" as executor.

**Official name:** In California, they're called "Letters" (probate code doesn't use "testamentary" but the term is common)

**Legal foundation:** California Probate Code Section 8400 et seq.

### Letters Testamentary vs. Letters of Administration

| Letters Testamentary | Letters of Administration |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Issued when there IS a will | Issued when there is NO will |
| Recipient called "executor" | Recipient called "administrator" |
| Executor named in will | Administrator appointed by court |
| Powers may be broader (if will grants) | Standard powers only |

**Important:** The powers and duties are essentially the same; the only real difference is whether there's a will.

**In practice:** Many people use "Letters Testamentary" for both situations, though technically the term applies only when there's a will.

## Why You Need Letters Testamentary

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get Letters Testamentary?

Typically 6-10 weeks from filing petition to receiving Letters. This includes the notice period, hearing, and processing time.

### Can I act as executor before receiving Letters?

Very limited actions only: secure property, notify beneficiaries, prevent loss. You cannot access financial accounts or conduct most estate business.

### Do Letters Testamentary work in other states?

California Letters are generally recognized in other states, but some states may require "exemplified copies" or ancillary probate for real property in that state.

### How much do Letters Testamentary cost?

$25-30 per certified copy. You pay no separate fee for the Letters themselves—they're included in the probate filing fee.

### What if I lose my Letters Testamentary?

You can order replacement certified copies anytime from the probate clerk's office for the standard fee.

### Can Letters Testamentary be revoked?

Yes, if you're removed as executor by the court due to misconduct, incapacity, or other reasons. The court would then issue Letters to a replacement executor.

### Do beneficiaries receive copies of Letters?

Not automatically, but they can request copies from the court. As executor, you should provide copies if requested.

### Can I use Letters Testamentary to access decedent's email or online accounts?

This is complicated. Some providers accept Letters, others require specific court orders. California Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act provides framework, but implementation varies.
