When someone dies in California, their assets must be transferred to beneficiaries. How that happens depends on whether they had a living trust or just a will.

Understanding the differences between trust administration and probate helps families know what to expect—and shows why estate planning matters.

## The Fundamental Difference

**Probate:** A court-supervised process to validate a will and distribute assets. Required when someone dies with assets in their name alone and no trust.

**Trust Administration:** A private process where a successor trustee distributes assets according to trust terms. No court involvement required.

Both accomplish the same goal—transferring assets to beneficiaries—but through very different paths.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Factor | Trust Administration | Probate |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| Court required | No | Yes |
| Timeline | 3-12 months | 12-18+ months |
| Cost | $3,000-$15,000 typical | $25,000-$100,000+ (statutory fees) |
| Privacy | Completely private | Public record |
| Oversight | Trustee self-directed | Court supervised |
| Flexibility | Based on trust terms | Strict legal procedures |
| Incapacity planning | Included | Separate conservatorship needed |
| Out-of-state property | One administration | Probate in each state |

## Cost Comparison: The Numbers

### Probate Costs

California law sets statutory fees for attorneys and executors based on gross estate value:

| Gross Estate | Attorney Fee | Executor Fee | Total Fees |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| $500,000 | $13,000 | $13,000 | $26,000 |
| $750,000 | $18,000 | $18,000 | $36,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $23,000 | $23,000 | $46,000 |
| $1,500,000 | $33,000 | $33,000 | $66,000 |
| $2,000,000 | $43,000 | $43,000 | $86,000 |

**Additional probate costs:**

- Filing fees: $435-$550
- Probate referee: 0.1% of assets
- Publication: $200-$400
- Bond premiums: varies

**Important:** Fees are based on GROSS value—before mortgages. A $1 million home with a $600,000 mortgage still generates fees based on $1 million.

### Trust Administration Costs

Trust administration has no statutory fees. Costs depend on complexity:

**Typical costs:**

- Attorney guidance: $3,000-$10,000
- CPA/tax preparation: $500-$3,000
- Deed recording: $50-$200
- Appraisals (if needed): $300-$500

**Total typical range:** $4,000-$15,000

### The Savings Are Real

**For a $1 million estate:**

- Probate costs: $46,000+ in statutory fees alone
- Trust administration: ~$8,000 typical
- **Savings: $38,000+**

**For a $1.5 million estate:**

- Probate costs: $66,000+ in statutory fees
- Trust administration: ~$10,000 typical
- **Savings: $56,000+**

## Timeline Comparison

### Probate Timeline

| Stage | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| File petition, schedule hearing | 4-6 weeks |
| Court appoints executor | 1 day (at hearing) |
| Creditor notification period | 4 months |
| Inventory and appraisal | 4 months |
| Estate administration | 6-12 months |
| Final accounting and hearing | 1-2 months |
| **Total** | **12-18+ months** |

### Trust Administration Timeline

| Stage | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Trustee takes control | Immediate |
| Notice to beneficiaries | Within 60 days |
| Contest period | 120 days |
| Pay debts and taxes | 2-4 months |
| Distribute assets | After contest period |
| **Total** | **3-12 months** |

Trust administration is faster because there's no waiting for court dates, no required hearings, and no judicial oversight of routine decisions.

## Privacy Comparison

### Probate: Completely Public

Everything filed in probate becomes public record:

- The will
- List of all assets and values
- Names and addresses of beneficiaries
- Creditor claims
- Disputes and litigation
- Final distribution details

Anyone can go to the courthouse and see what you owned and who received it.

**Real-world consequence:** "Heir hunters," scammers, and salespeople regularly search probate records to target beneficiaries.

### Trust Administration: Completely Private

Trust administration happens outside the court system:

- Trust document is not filed publicly
- Asset lists remain private
- Beneficiary information stays confidential
- Only involved parties know the details

The only people who see trust information are those entitled to it under California law (beneficiaries, heirs who receive the required notice).

## Control and Flexibility

### Probate: Court Controlled

The executor must:

- Follow statutory procedures exactly
- Get court approval for many actions
- File regular reports with the court
- Attend multiple hearings
- Wait for court schedules

Even with Independent Administration authority (IAEA), some actions require court involvement.

### Trust Administration: Trustee Controlled

The trustee:

- Follows trust terms (not court procedures)
- Makes most decisions independently
- Doesn't need court approval for routine matters
- Works on their own timeline
- Has flexibility to respond to circumstances

The trust document—not a judge—controls the process.

## Out-of-State Property

### Probate: Multiple Proceedings

If someone dies owning real estate in multiple states, their family faces:

- **Domiciliary probate:** In the state where they lived
- **Ancillary probate:** In each additional state where they owned property

Each ancillary probate means:

- Hiring local attorneys
- Filing separate court cases
- Paying additional fees
- Extended timelines

**Example:** California resident owns a vacation home in Arizona. Family must complete full probate in California AND separate probate in Arizona.

### Trust Administration: One Process

A properly funded living trust avoids this entirely:

- Trust covers property in all states
- One administration process
- One set of professionals
- No ancillary proceedings

The successor trustee simply transfers property in each state according to trust terms.

## Incapacity Planning

### Will Only: No Protection

A will only takes effect at death. It provides no help if you become incapacitated while alive.

Without a trust, if you become unable to manage your affairs:

- Family may need court conservatorship
- Conservatorship is expensive and intrusive
- Court supervises all financial decisions
- Annual accountings required

### Living Trust: Built-In Protection

A living trust includes incapacity planning:

- If you become incapacitated, successor trustee takes over
- No court proceeding needed
- Seamless transition of management
- Privacy maintained

This is a significant benefit many people overlook when comparing trusts to wills.

## When Probate Is Unavoidable

Even with a trust, you might face probate if:

### Assets weren't transferred to the trust

A trust only controls assets actually transferred to it. Property left in your individual name goes through probate.

### Small amounts left outside trust

If amounts are under $184,500, simplified procedures may apply—but it's still a form of probate.

### Trust is invalid

If the trust wasn't properly executed, assets may go through probate.

## When Trust Administration Has Court Involvement

While most trust administration is private, courts get involved for:

- Trust contests by beneficiaries or heirs
- Disputes between trustee and beneficiaries
- Requests for instructions on ambiguous terms
- Trustee removal petitions
- Trust modification requests

These situations are relatively rare for well-drafted trusts with clear terms.

## Which Is Better?

For most California families—especially homeowners—trust administration is clearly better:

✓ Faster (months vs. years)
✓ Cheaper (saves $30,000-$80,000+ for typical estates)
✓ Private (no public record)
✓ Flexible (trustee-controlled)
✓ Includes incapacity planning
✓ Simpler for multi-state property

**The catch:** You must create the trust AND fund it properly during your lifetime. The upfront cost ($2,000-$5,000) pays for itself many times over.
