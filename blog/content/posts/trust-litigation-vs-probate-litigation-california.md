# Trust Litigation vs Probate Litigation California: Key Differences

Many people assume contesting a trust is similar to contesting a will. While both involve challenging estate planning documents, trust litigation and probate litigation in California have significant differences in procedure, venue, timing, and difficulty. Understanding these distinctions is critical for anyone considering a challenge.

This guide explains the key differences between trust and probate litigation in California and strategic implications for each.

## Fundamental Difference

### Probate Litigation

**What it is:** Contesting a will that must go through probate court

**Process:**
- Will filed with probate court
- Executor petitions for probate
- Contestants file objections
- Probate judge presides
- Public process

### Trust Litigation

**What it is:** Contesting a trust (typically revocable living trust) that avoids probate

**Process:**
- Trust administered privately (usually)
- Contestant files petition in probate court
- Litigation initiated by contestant
- Probate judge presides (but trust not "in probate")
- More private initially

## Venue Differences

### Probate Litigation Venue

**Where to file:**
- Probate must be filed in county where decedent resided
- Cannot choose venue
- Fixed by residence

**Example:**
Decedent lived in Los Angeles County → Will must be probated there

### Trust Litigation Venue

**More flexibility:**
- County where settlor resided at death, OR
- County where trust is being administered, OR
- County where trustee resides

**Strategic choice possible**

**Example:**
- Settlor lived in Los Angeles
- Trustee lives in Orange County
- Trust being administered in San Diego
- **Contestant can choose** among these venues

**Why this matters:**
- Some judges more experienced with trust disputes
- Convenience for parties/witnesses
- Local court culture differences

## Standing to Contest

### Will Contest Standing

**Who can contest:**
- **Heirs at law** (would inherit under intestacy)
- **Named beneficiaries** in current will
- **Named beneficiaries** in prior will
- **Creditors** of estate

**Broad standing** - Many people have interest

### Trust Contest Standing

**Who can contest:**
- **Beneficiaries** of contested trust
- **Beneficiaries** of prior trust
- **Heirs at law** (if trust invalid, intestacy applies)

**Similar but narrower** - Must show interest

**Key difference:**
Probate is public proceeding so anyone with standing can easily participate. Trust administration is private so contestants may not know trust exists.

## Statute of Limitations

### Will Contest Deadline

**California Probate Code §8226:**
- **120 days** from admission of will to probate
- Starts when will formally admitted by court
- Published notice triggers deadline

**Deadline certain and publicized**

### Trust Contest Deadline

**California Probate Code §16061.8:**
- **120 days** from receiving notice trust became irrevocable
- Starts when trustee sends proper notice
- No public notice requirement

**Problems:**
- Trustee may not send notice
- Beneficiaries may not know trust exists
- Deadline may never start if no notice
- Can challenge years later if never notified

**Advantage for trust contestants:** Longer window if trustee doesn't comply with notice requirements

## Discovery Differences

### Probate Litigation Discovery

**More limited initially:**
- Will filed with court (public record)
- Petition for probate includes basic information
- Some information automatically public

**Later discovery similar** to trust litigation

### Trust Litigation Discovery

**More extensive often needed:**
- Trust not public unless filed with court
- Must discover trust terms through formal discovery
- May need to compel trustee to provide documents
- More initial work to understand situation

**Strategic:** Trust beneficiaries may not have seen trust until litigation starts

## Burden of Proof

### Will Contest Burden

**Contestant must prove:**
- Grounds for invalidity (capacity, undue influence, fraud, etc.)
- By **clear and convincing evidence**

**Presumption of validity** once will admitted to probate

### Trust Contest Burden

**Same standard:**
- Contestant must prove grounds
- **Clear and convincing evidence** required
- Presumption of validity

**No significant difference** in burden

## Common Grounds

### Will Contest Grounds

1. Lack of testamentary capacity
2. Undue influence
3. Fraud
4. Duress
5. Improper execution
6. Revocation

**Same grounds as trust contests**

### Trust Contest Grounds

1. Lack of capacity
2. Undue influence
3. Fraud
4. Duress
5. Improper execution (rare)
6. Revocation

**Identical substantive law** for most grounds

## Which Is Harder to Contest?

### Factors Making Trust Contests Easier

**1. Notice Issues**
- May have more time if trustee didn't send notice
- Deadline may never start
- Can challenge years later

**2. Less Public Process**
- Trust administration private initially
- Can file petition before trust widely known
- Less public pressure

**3. Venue Selection**
- Can sometimes choose favorable venue
- Shop for experienced judge

### Factors Making Trust Contests Harder

**1. Finding Out About Trust**
- No automatic public filing
- May not know trust exists
- No published notice
- Must rely on trustee to disclose

**2. Getting Trust Document**
- Must request from trustee
- May face resistance
- Need formal petition if refused
- Takes time to obtain

**3. Evidence Collection**
- Trust administration more private
- Records may be harder to obtain
- Less court oversight during administration

**4. Proving Undue Influence**
- Often alleging influence over long period
- More gradual changes to trust (multiple amendments)
- Harder to pinpoint exact moment of influence

### Factors Making Probate Contests Easier

**1. Automatic Public Filing**
- Will filed with court
- Public notice published
- Everyone can see will exists
- Terms become public

**2. Court Supervision**
- Probate court oversees process
- More transparency
- Regular court hearings

### Factors Making Probate Contests Harder

**1. Strict Deadline**
- 120 days certain and short
- Publicized so no excuse for missing
- Must act quickly

**2. Limited Venue**
- No choice of venue
- Stuck with decedent's residence county

**3. Public Process**
- Everything on public record
- Family conflict exposed
- More publicity

## Cost Comparison

### Probate Litigation Costs

**Typical attorney fees:**
- Through contest: $50,000-$150,000
- Complex cases: $150,000-$300,000+

**Other costs:**
- Expert witnesses: $20,000-$50,000
- Court fees: $1,000-$3,000
- Depositions: $5,000-$15,000

### Trust Litigation Costs

**Similar range:**
- Through trial: $75,000-$200,000
- Complex cases: $200,000-$500,000+

**Often higher because:**
- More initial discovery needed
- May need petition just to get trust document
- Private administration means more investigation

### Fee Recovery

**Both types:**
- Prevailing party may recover fees
- Trust/estate typically pays reasonable defense costs
- Losing contestant may not recover fees

## Strategic Considerations

### When You Have a Choice

**If decedent had both will and trust:**

**Contest trust if:**
- Trust terms worse than will
- Trust easier to prove invalid
- Venue selection advantages
- Notice wasn't properly given
- Want more time

**Contest will if:**
- Will terms worse than trust
- Will clearly invalid
- Already in probate court
- Deadline approaching

### No-Contest Clauses

**Apply to both:**
- Will and trust can have no-contest clauses
- Both enforceable in California (with probable cause exception)
- Same risk in either contest

**No advantage** to one over other regarding no-contest clauses

## Simultaneous Will and Trust

### Common Scenario

**Pour-over will with trust:**
- Will leaves everything to trust
- Trust contains actual distributions
- Will goes through probate
- Trust receives assets

**If contest both:**
- Will contest in probate court
- Trust contest separate petition
- May be consolidated
- Same or different grounds possible

### Coordinated Strategy

**Often necessary to contest both:**
- Invalid trust → Assets go to will beneficiaries
- Invalid will → Assets go to intestacy or trust
- May need to challenge both to succeed

## Heirs vs. Trust Beneficiaries

### Different Interests

**In probate:**
- Heirs may contest to invalidate will
- Want intestacy to apply

**In trust litigation:**
- Trust beneficiaries contest to invalidate trust
- Want prior trust or intestacy

**Sometimes same people, sometimes not**

**Strategic:** May benefit from trust contest but not will contest (or vice versa)

## Timeline Comparison

### Probate Contest Timeline

- Will filed: Day 1
- 120-day contest period begins
- Contest filed by Day 120
- Discovery: 6-12 months
- Trial: 12-24 months from filing
- **Total: 18-30 months**

### Trust Contest Timeline

- Notice received: Day 1 (or whenever)
- 120-day period begins (if proper notice)
- Contest filed by Day 120
- Discovery: 6-12 months
- Mediation: Often required
- Trial: 12-24 months from filing
- **Total: 18-30 months (similar)**

**Timelines comparable** once litigation starts

## Settlement Rates

### Probate Contests

**Settlement rate:** 60-70% settle before trial

**Settlement timing:** Often after discovery, before trial

### Trust Contests

**Settlement rate:** 70-80% settle before trial

**Higher settlement rate because:**
- Mediation often court-ordered
- More privacy incentive
- Family dynamics (trust typically for family)
- Costs of litigation

## Practical Differences Summary

| Factor | Probate Litigation | Trust Litigation |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Venue** | Fixed (decedent's county) | Multiple options |
| **Public filing** | Required | Not initially |
| **Notice** | Published | Private (trustee sends) |
| **Deadline** | Certain | May be extended if no notice |
| **Access to document** | Automatic (filed with court) | Must request from trustee |
| **Discovery** | Standard | Often more extensive |
| **Privacy** | Public process | More private initially |
| **Court supervision** | Ongoing | Limited (unless petition filed) |
| **Settlement rate** | 60-70% | 70-80% |

## Conclusion

While trust and probate litigation share many similarities (grounds, burden of proof, costs), they differ significantly in procedure, venue, and practical considerations. Trust litigation offers more venue flexibility and potentially more time, but requires more initial work to discover trust terms. Probate litigation is more transparent but has stricter deadlines.

**Key takeaways:**
- Trust contests: More venue options, notice issues favor contestants, more private
- Probate contests: Public process, strict deadlines, automatic filing
- Similar costs, timelines, and substantive law
- Trust contests have higher settlement rates
- Consider which document to contest based on strategic advantages

If you're considering contesting either a will or trust, consult an experienced litigation attorney to determine the best strategy for your situation.
