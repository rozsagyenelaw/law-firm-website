One of the most confusing aspects of trust administration is taxes. What returns need to be filed? When are they due? What happens if you miss a deadline?

This guide explains the tax obligations trustees face during California trust administration.

## Overview: Which Tax Returns Are Required?

Trust administration typically requires filing multiple tax returns:

| Return | What It Covers | Who Files | When Due |
|--------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Final Form 1040 | Deceased's federal income | Trustee or surviving spouse | April 15 following death |
| Final Form 540 | Deceased's California income | Trustee or surviving spouse | April 15 following death |
| Form 1041 | Trust federal income | Trustee | April 15 or 65 days after fiscal year |
| Form 541 | Trust California income | Trustee | Same as Form 1041 |
| Form 706 | Federal estate tax | Trustee | 9 months from death (if required) |

Not every trust administration requires all of these. Let's break down each one.

## The Deceased's Final Income Tax Returns

### Form 1040 (Federal) and Form 540 (California)

**What they cover:** Income the deceased earned from January 1 through the date of death.

**Who files:** The trustee, executor, or surviving spouse (if filing jointly).

**When due:** April 15 of the year following death (can request extension).

### What to Include

**Income items:**

- Wages and salary (through date of death)
- Interest and dividends earned through death
- Capital gains from sales before death
- Rental income through date of death
- Social Security benefits
- Pension and retirement distributions
- Business income
- Any other taxable income

**Common deductions:**

- Medical expenses paid before death
- Property taxes paid
- Mortgage interest paid
- Charitable contributions made
- State income taxes paid

### Filing Status

**If deceased was married:**

- Surviving spouse can file jointly for the year of death
- This usually results in lower taxes
- Surviving spouse signs the return

**If deceased was single:**

- File as Single or Head of Household (if qualified)
- Trustee signs the return as "Filing as surviving trustee"

### Example Timeline

- **Death date:** July 15, 2024
- **Final return covers:** January 1, 2024 – July 15, 2024
- **Return due:** April 15, 2025
- **Extension available:** October 15, 2025

## Trust Income Tax Returns

### Form 1041 (Federal) and Form 541 (California)

Once the grantor dies, the trust becomes a separate taxpaying entity. Any income earned by trust assets AFTER the death must be reported on trust tax returns.

**What they cover:** Trust income from the date of death through the end of the tax year.

**Who files:** The trustee.

**When due:** April 15 of the following year (for calendar year trusts), or 65 days after the fiscal year ends.

### Trust Tax Year Options

- **Calendar year:** January 1 – December 31 (most common for ongoing trusts)
- **Fiscal year:** Any 12-month period ending on the last day of a month (available for estates and some trusts)

### What Income Must Be Reported

The trust must report income earned by trust assets after the death:

- Interest earned on trust bank accounts
- Dividends from trust investments
- Capital gains from selling trust assets
- Rental income from trust property
- Business income from trust-owned businesses
- Any other income earned by trust assets

### Trust Tax Rates (2024)

Trusts reach the highest tax brackets at very low income levels:

| Taxable Income | Federal Tax Rate |
|----------------|------------------|
| $0 - $3,100 | 10% |
| $3,100 - $11,150 | 24% |
| $11,150 - $15,200 | 35% |
| Over $15,200 | 37% |

**Important:** These brackets are much narrower than individual rates. A trust with just $15,200 in income pays the highest marginal rate!

### Distributable Net Income (DNI) and K-1s

Trusts can often avoid high tax rates by distributing income to beneficiaries:

- Income distributed to beneficiaries is deducted from trust income
- Beneficiaries receive Form K-1 showing their share
- Beneficiaries report the income on their personal returns (usually at lower rates)

**Strategy:** Distribute income to beneficiaries to avoid the trust's high tax rates.

### Example

**Trust earns $50,000 in income**

**Option A - Keep in trust:**
- Trust pays approximately $15,000 in federal taxes (35-37% rate)

**Option B - Distribute to beneficiaries:**
- Trust deducts $50,000 distribution
- Two beneficiaries each receive $25,000
- Each pays approximately $3,000 in taxes (at their lower individual rates)
- Total taxes: $6,000
- **Savings from distribution: $9,000**

## Estate Tax Returns

### Form 706 (Federal Estate Tax)

**When required:** Only if the gross estate exceeds the federal exemption amount.

**2024 exemption:** $13.61 million per person

**When due:** 9 months from date of death (6-month extension available)

**Important:** Most estates don't owe estate tax because they're under the exemption. But there may be reasons to file Form 706 even if no tax is owed:

### Portability Election

If the deceased was married and the estate is under the exemption amount, the trustee can file Form 706 to "port" the unused exemption to the surviving spouse.

**Example:**

- Husband dies with $5 million estate
- Exemption is $13.61 million
- Unused exemption: $8.61 million
- This can be added to wife's exemption if Form 706 is filed

**Result:** Wife can potentially shield $22.22 million from estate tax instead of just $13.61 million.

### California Estate Tax

**Good news:** California has NO state estate tax.

Only the federal estate tax applies to California residents.

## The Trust's Tax ID Number (EIN)

### Why You Need It

After the grantor dies, the trust needs its own tax identification number. You cannot use the deceased's Social Security number.

**The EIN is required for:**

- Opening trust bank accounts
- Filing trust tax returns
- Reporting income to the IRS
- Providing to financial institutions

### How to Get It

- **Online (fastest):** IRS.gov → EIN Assistant → Takes about 10 minutes
- **By mail:** Submit Form SS-4 → Takes 4-6 weeks
- **By fax:** Submit Form SS-4 → Takes about 1 week

### When to Apply

Apply for the EIN shortly after the grantor's death—you'll need it to open the trust bank account and conduct other business.

## Stepped-Up Basis: The Major Tax Benefit

One of the biggest tax advantages of inherited assets is the "stepped-up basis."

### What It Means

When someone dies, the cost basis of their assets "steps up" to fair market value at death. This eliminates capital gains on appreciation that occurred during the deceased's lifetime.

### Example

- **Original purchase:** Mom bought stock for $10,000 in 1990
- **Value at death:** $100,000
- **Stepped-up basis:** $100,000

**If sold immediately after death:**

- Sale price: $100,000
- Basis: $100,000
- Capital gain: $0
- Tax: $0

**Without step-up (if Mom had sold before death):**

- Sale price: $100,000
- Original basis: $10,000
- Capital gain: $90,000
- Tax: ~$20,000+ (depending on rates)

### Documenting Stepped-Up Basis

**Critical task:** Document the fair market value of all assets as of the date of death.

- **For securities:** Get statement showing values on date of death
- **For real estate:** Get appraisal as of date of death
- **For other assets:** Document fair market value with appropriate evidence

This documentation is essential for future tax reporting if beneficiaries sell inherited assets.

## Common Tax Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using the Wrong Tax ID

After death, use the trust's EIN—not the deceased's Social Security number—for all trust transactions and accounts.

### Mistake 2: Missing Deadlines

| Return | Deadline | Extension Available |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Form 1040/540 | April 15 | Yes (6 months) |
| Form 1041/541 | April 15 | Yes (5.5 months) |
| Form 706 | 9 months | Yes (6 months) |

Missing deadlines triggers penalties and interest.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring State Returns

California requires its own returns (Form 540 and Form 541). Don't forget state obligations.

### Mistake 4: Not Making Estimated Payments

If the trust has significant income, quarterly estimated tax payments may be required to avoid penalties.

**Estimated tax due dates:**

- April 15
- June 15
- September 15
- January 15 (following year)

### Mistake 5: Not Distributing Income Strategically

Trusts pay high tax rates. Distributing income to beneficiaries (who often have lower rates) can save thousands in taxes. Work with a CPA on distribution timing.

### Mistake 6: Forgetting the Portability Election

If the deceased was married and the estate is under the exemption, consider filing Form 706 solely for the portability election—even if no estate tax is owed.

### Mistake 7: Not Documenting Stepped-Up Basis

Failing to document date-of-death values can cost beneficiaries significantly if they sell inherited assets later.

## When to Hire a CPA

Trust tax returns are complex. Consider professional help if:

- The trust has significant income
- Real estate or business interests are involved
- Estate may owe estate tax
- Multiple beneficiaries with different distributions
- You're unfamiliar with trust taxation
- The deceased had complex financial affairs

**The cost:** CPA fees for trust returns typically run $500-$2,500 depending on complexity.

**Who pays:** Professional fees are paid from trust assets, not your personal funds.
