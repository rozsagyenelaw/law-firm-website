**You've just been named successor trustee** of a loved one's trust. Now what? Where do you even start?

Whether you're handling a simple family trust or complex estate, this guide gives you the roadmap to fulfill your duties properly and avoid personal liability.

## What Is a Successor Trustee in California?

A **successor trustee** is the person (or institution) named in a trust document to take over management when the original trustee dies or becomes incapacitated.

**Your role:**
- Manage trust assets
- Follow trust terms exactly
- Protect assets for beneficiaries
- Distribute according to trust provisions
- File tax returns
- Communicate with beneficiaries
- Act as fiduciary with legal duties

**You are NOT:**
- Free to do whatever you want
- Able to favor yourself or family
- Allowed to ignore beneficiaries
- Permitted to delay unreasonably
- Exempt from accounting requirements

## Successor Trustee Legal Duties (Fiduciary Duties)

Under California Probate Code, you owe beneficiaries these fiduciary duties:

### 1. Duty of Loyalty (§ 16002)
- Act solely in beneficiaries' interests
- No self-dealing
- No conflicts of interest
- Cannot profit from position (except reasonable compensation)

### 2. Duty to Deal Impartially (§ 16003)
- Treat all beneficiaries fairly
- Cannot favor one beneficiary over another (unless trust allows)
- Balance interests of current vs. remainder beneficiaries

### 3. Duty of Care (§ 16040-16047)
- Administer trust with care, skill, prudence
- Standard: what would a prudent person do?
- Invest wisely
- Preserve assets
- Act reasonably and promptly

### 4. Duty to Inform and Account (§ 16060-16069)
- Keep beneficiaries reasonably informed
- Respond to reasonable requests
- Provide accountings
- Disclose material facts

### 5. Duty to Follow Trust Terms (§ 16000)
- Administer according to trust document
- Cannot change terms (unless court modifies)
- Must distribute as trust requires

**Breach of these duties = Personal liability** for losses, surcharge, removal, and payment of beneficiaries' attorney fees.

## Successor Trustee Checklist: First Steps After Death

### Immediate Actions (First 2 Weeks)

**☐ Locate Original Trust Document**
- Find the original signed trust
- Locate all amendments and restatements
- Find related documents (pour-over will, etc.)
- Make copies for your records

**☐ Obtain Certified Death Certificates**

- Cost: ~$25 each

**☐ Secure Trust Property**
- Take possession of real estate
- Change locks if necessary (especially if beneficiaries have access)
- Ensure adequate insurance
- Secure valuables
- Arrange for property maintenance
- Cancel utilities/services at deceased's residence (or transfer to trust name)

**☐ Review Trust Document Thoroughly**

- Investment companies
- Credit card companies
- Utilities
- Subscription services

## Month 1-2: Legal Requirements & Notifications

**☐ Obtain Tax ID Number (EIN)**
- Apply for Employer Identification Number for the trust
- File online at IRS.gov (Form SS-4) - takes 15 minutes
- FREE - don't pay services to do this
- Needed to open trust bank account and file tax returns

**☐ Open Trust Estate Bank Account**
- Open checking account in trust name
- Use format: "[Your Name], Trustee of [Trust Name] Trust"
- Provide bank with: EIN, death certificate, trust certification (not full trust)
- Deposit all trust income here
- Pay all trust expenses from this account
- NEVER commingle with your personal funds

**☐ Send 60-Day Notice to Beneficiaries (CRITICAL!)**
**This is the #1 most commonly missed requirement**

Under California Probate Code § 16061.7, you MUST serve written notice to:
- All trust beneficiaries
- All heirs of deceased trustor (even if not in trust)
- Any prior beneficiaries whose interests terminated

**Notice must include:**
- Your name, address, phone as trustee
- Statement that you're serving as trustee
- Deceased's name and date of death
- Notice of right to request trust copy
- Information about 120-day contest period
- Physical address of administration

**Deadline:** Within 60 days after death OR after you accept role as trustee

**Failure to send this notice:**
- Extends beneficiaries' time to contest indefinitely
- Can lead to your removal as trustee
- Creates personal liability risk
- Courts take this very seriously

**☐ Provide Trust Copies to Beneficiaries**
- Any beneficiary who requests gets complete copy
- Must include all amendments
- Cannot charge fee
- Cannot refuse or delay
- Cannot redact or withhold portions

**☐ Notify Creditors**
- Not legally required (unlike probate)
- But good practice to notify known creditors
- Publish notice in newspaper (optional but recommended)
- Creates deadline for claims (120 days)

## Months 2-4: Asset Management & Valuation

**☐ Inventory All Trust Assets**

Create comprehensive list including:

**Real Property:**
- Addresses
- Legal descriptions

**Bank Accounts:**
- Institution names
- Account numbers
- Account types
- Balances as of date of death

**Investment Accounts:**
- Brokerage accounts

**☐ Obtain Date-of-Death Valuations**

For ALL assets, get values as of date of death:
- **Real estate**: Professional appraisal ($300-800)
- **Stocks/bonds**: Trading price on death date
- **Business interests**: Business valuation (CPA or specialist)
- **Personal property**: Appraisal for valuable items
- **Retirement accounts**: Statement showing death-date balance

**Why critical:** Date-of-death values determine:
- Basis for capital gains tax purposes
- Estate tax calculations (if estate over $13.61M)
- Fair distribution among beneficiaries

**☐ Retitle Assets Into Trust Name (If Needed)**

Assets should already be in trust, but often some aren't:
- Real property: Record new deed showing trust ownership
- Bank accounts: Provide death certificate to transfer
- Investment accounts: Transfer to trust name
- Vehicles: Transfer title through DMV

**☐ Manage Trust Assets Prudently**
- Maintain property (repairs, landscaping, insurance)
- Review investments for diversification

- Utilities
- Maintenance
- HOA fees

- California has NO estate tax (but federal may apply)

**☐ File Trust Income Tax Returns**
- IRS Form 1041 (Fiduciary Income Tax Return)
- Due: April 15 for calendar year trusts

- May need to file estimated quarterly taxes

**☐ File Final Property Tax Statement**
- Notify county assessor of owner's death
- Prevent property tax reassessment if transferring to children (Prop 19)
- Pay property taxes when due

**☐ Prepare Accounting**

Even if not required by trust, prepare detailed accounting showing:
- All assets at death (with values)

**☐ Obtain Receipt and Release**

Before distributing, get beneficiaries to sign:

**If beneficiary refuses to sign:** You can still distribute, but document thoroughly. Consider petitioning court for approval.

**☐ File Final Accounting**

## Final Steps: Closing Administration

## Common Successor Trustee Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Mistake 1: Not Sending 60-Day Notice**
This is the #1 violation. Extends beneficiaries' contest period indefinitely. Always send proper notice within 60 days.

**❌ Mistake 2: Commingling Funds**
NEVER mix trust money with your personal money. Maintain separate trust account for everything.

**❌ Mistake 3: Favoring Yourself or Family**
If you're also a beneficiary, you cannot favor yourself. Treat all beneficiaries equally unless trust says otherwise.

**❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Beneficiary Requests**
Beneficiaries have legal rights. Respond promptly to requests for information, copies of trust, accountings.

**❌ Mistake 5: Delaying Unreasonably**
"I'm busy" is not valid excuse. If you can't fulfill duties promptly, resign and let someone else serve.

**❌ Mistake 6: Not Keeping Records**
Document EVERYTHING. Save every receipt, statement, communication. You'll need it for accounting and to defend yourself if challenged.

**❌ Mistake 7: Making Distributions Too Early**
Wait until debts/taxes paid and claim period expires. Distributing too early creates personal liability if money needed later.

**❌ Mistake 8: Not Getting Professional Help**
90% of non-lawyer trustees make mistakes. Hire an attorney - it's worth it for asset protection and liability protection.

**❌ Mistake 9: Using Trust Assets Personally**
Cannot live in trust house rent-free, drive trust car, or use trust funds for personal benefit. Self-dealing = breach of duty.

**❌ Mistake 10: Not Maintaining Property**
Letting property deteriorate, missing insurance payments, or ignoring maintenance = breach of duty of care.

## Do You Need an Attorney for Trust Administration?

**Legally required? No.**
**Practically essential? YES.**

**90% of trustees who "do it themselves" make costly mistakes:**
- Miss 60-day notice requirement
- Fail to obtain proper valuations
- Don't maintain adequate records
- Make improper distributions
- Miss tax filing deadlines
- Expose themselves to personal liability

**Attorney helps with:**
- 60-day notices (proper format, service, documentation)
- Creditor notification and claim procedures
- Tax planning and returns
- Accounting preparation
- Beneficiary disputes
- Distribution planning
- Protecting YOU from liability

**Cost:** Typically 1-3% of estate value. Much less than defending against beneficiary lawsuit or paying surcharge for mistakes.

## Trustee Compensation California

**You're entitled to reasonable compensation** under Probate Code § 15681.

**Typical rates:**
- **Family trustees**: Often serve without compensation (but entitled to it)
- **Professional trustees**: 1-1.5% of estate value OR $50-150/hour
- **Corporate trustees**: 1-2% of estate value annually

**Factors affecting reasonableness:**
- Time spent
- Complexity of estate
- Skill required
- Results achieved
- Customary fees in community

**Must be "reasonable"** - courts can reduce excessive fees.

**Document your time** even if not charging. Helps defend against beneficiary challenges.

## When Can You Resign as Successor Trustee?

**You CAN resign** if:
- Job too overwhelming
- Conflicts with beneficiaries
- Don't have time
- Health issues
- Moving away

**Proper resignation process:**
1. Review trust for resignation provisions
2. Send written notice to all beneficiaries (30-60 days advance notice)
3. Prepare accounting through resignation date
4. Identify successor trustee (per trust terms)
5. Transfer all records and assets to new trustee
6. File resignation with court (if required)

**Cannot resign to:**
- Avoid liability for past breaches

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a successor trustee get paid in California?

As successor trustee, you're entitled to reasonable compensation under California Probate Code Section 15681, even if you're a family member. Typical rates are 1-1.5% of the estate value or $50-150 per hour for individual trustees, while corporate trustees typically charge 1-2% of estate value annually. Factors affecting reasonableness include time spent, estate complexity, skill required, results achieved, and customary fees in the community. Document your time even if you choose not to charge, as this helps defend against beneficiary challenges to your compensation.

### What happens if I miss the 60-day notice deadline in California?

Missing the 60-day notice deadline under California Probate Code Section 16061.7 is the most common and serious mistake successor trustees make. If you fail to send the required notice within 60 days of death or accepting your role as trustee, the 120-day trust contest period never starts, meaning beneficiaries can challenge the trust indefinitely. This also exposes you to personal liability for breach of fiduciary duty, potential removal as trustee, and beneficiary lawsuits. Courts take this requirement very seriously, so always send the notice by certified mail immediately and keep proof of mailing.

### Do I need a lawyer to administer a trust in California?

While not legally required, hiring an attorney is practically essential for trust administration. Statistics show that 90% of trustees who handle administration themselves make costly mistakes, including missing the 60-day notice requirement, failing to obtain proper valuations, not maintaining adequate records, making improper distributions, and missing tax filing deadlines. An attorney typically costs 1-3% of the estate value, which is significantly less than defending against a beneficiary lawsuit or paying surcharges for mistakes. Professional guidance protects you from personal liability while ensuring all legal requirements are met.

### How long does trust administration take after death in California?

Trust administration timelines vary by complexity. A simple trust with only liquid assets and no disputes typically takes 6-9 months. An average trust with real estate, stocks, and standard assets takes 9-18 months. Complex trusts involving business interests, disputes, or significant tax issues can take 18-36 months. The minimum timeline is approximately 6 months due to the required creditor claim period and tax filing requirements. Factors affecting the timeline include estate complexity, whether real estate needs to be sold, beneficiary disputes, tax issues, illiquid assets, and any court involvement.

### Can I resign as successor trustee if it's too overwhelming?

Yes, you can resign as successor trustee if the job is too overwhelming, you have conflicts with beneficiaries, lack time, have health issues, or are moving away. The proper resignation process involves reviewing the trust for resignation provisions, sending written notice to all beneficiaries (30-60 days advance notice), preparing an accounting through your resignation date, identifying the next successor trustee per the trust terms, transferring all records and assets to the new trustee, and filing resignation with the court if required. However, you cannot resign to avoid liability for past breaches, escape accounting requirements, or abandon duties midstream without proper transition.
