# No-Contest Clauses in California Trusts: Enforceability and Strategy

No-contest clauses (also called "in terrorem" clauses) are provisions that disinherit anyone who contests a trust. These clauses are meant to discourage litigation, but California law significantly limits their enforcement. Understanding when no-contest clauses apply, the "probable cause" exception, and how to navigate them is critical for anyone considering a trust challenge.

This guide covers everything you need to know about no-contest clauses in California.

## What Is a No-Contest Clause?

### Definition

**No-contest clause:** Trust provision that disinherits any beneficiary who contests the trust or challenges trustee actions.

**Also called:**
- In terrorem clause ("to frighten")
- Forfeiture clause
- Penalty clause

### Typical Language

**Example clause:**
"If any beneficiary of this trust contests or attacks this trust or any of its provisions, or aids anyone else in doing so, that person shall receive nothing from this trust and shall be deemed to have predeceased me."

### Purpose

**Settlor's goals:**
- Discourage frivolous challenges
- Prevent family litigation
- Preserve estate for intended beneficiaries
- Reduce legal fees eating estate
- Ensure plan implemented as written

## California Law on No-Contest Clauses

### Probate Code §21311

**California's restrictive rule:**

No-contest clause is enforceable ONLY if contest brought **without probable cause**.

**If probable cause exists:** No-contest clause NOT enforced

**This is huge protection** for beneficiaries with legitimate concerns

### What Changed in 2010

**Old law (pre-2010):**
- No-contest clauses broadly enforced
- Difficult to challenge trusts
- Even reasonable challenges triggered forfeiture

**New law (2010-present):**
- Probable cause exception
- Encourages legitimate challenges
- Protects beneficiaries who act reasonably

**Much more beneficiary-friendly** than prior law

## The Probable Cause Standard

### Definition

**Probate Code §21311(b):**

"Probable cause" exists if, at the time of filing the contest, the facts known to the contestant would cause a reasonable person to believe there is a reasonable likelihood of success.

**Objective standard** - What would reasonable person think?

### Factors Courts Consider

**In determining probable cause:**

1. **Facts known** at time of filing (not discovered later)
2. **Reasonable belief** of success (not certain success)
3. **Good faith** of contestant
4. **Evidence available** before filing
5. **Legal advice received**

**Key:** Assessed at time of filing, not after trial

### What Constitutes Probable Cause

**Probable cause exists when:**

**For capacity challenge:**
- Medical records showing dementia/Alzheimer's
- Doctor's diagnosis of incapacity
- Witnesses to confusion
- MMSE scores showing impairment
- Reasonable belief incapacity existed

**For undue influence:**
- Evidence of isolation
- Confidential relationship
- Sudden trust changes
- Disproportionate benefit
- Suspicious circumstances

**For fraud:**
- Evidence of misrepresentations
- Witnesses to false statements
- Documentary proof of deception

**Don't need to win** - Just need reasonable grounds at filing

### Examples

**Example 1 - Probable Cause Exists:**
- Father diagnosed with Alzheimer's 2 years before death
- Medical records show severe cognitive decline
- MMSE score 10/30 (severe impairment)
- Trust amended 1 month before death
- Amendment benefits caregiver
**Probable cause: Yes - Reasonable challenge**

**Example 2 - NO Probable Cause:**
- Mother mentally sharp, no medical issues
- Trust consistent with prior statements
- Prepared by experienced attorney
- Daughter contests because "it's not fair"
- No evidence of capacity/influence issues
**Probable cause: No - Frivolous challenge**

**Example 3 - Probable Cause (close call):**
- Father age 90, some memory issues
- No formal dementia diagnosis
- Trust prepared by attorney father trusted for years
- Provisions favor one child over others
- Some family conflict
**Probable cause: Probably - Enough for reasonable belief**

## What Actions Trigger No-Contest Clause

### Direct Trust Contest

**Clear triggers:**
- Petition to invalidate entire trust
- Petition to invalidate specific provisions
- Challenge to trust amendments
- Claim trust procured by fraud/undue influence

**These clearly contest trust**

### Trustee Removal Petitions

**California law:**
- Petitions to remove trustee do NOT trigger no-contest clause
- Even if trustee is beneficiary
- Public policy: Need to hold trustees accountable

**Exception:** If removal petition is a "de facto" contest of trust validity

### Requests for Information

**Do NOT trigger:**
- Request for copy of trust
- Request for accounting
- Questions about administration
- Request for beneficiary information

**California law protects** information requests

### Interpretation Petitions

**Usually do NOT trigger:**
- Petition to interpret ambiguous provisions
- Petition for instructions
- Clarification of trustee powers

**Not challenging validity** - Asking court to construe

### Challenges to Trust Administration

**Generally do NOT trigger:**
- Challenge to improper distributions
- Objection to trustee fees
- Challenge to investment decisions
- Claims trustee breached fiduciary duties

**Gray area:** Depends on whether challenging trust itself or just administration

## Strategic Considerations

### Before Filing Contest

**Critical analysis:**

**1. Do you have probable cause?**
- Consult attorney immediately
- Review medical records
- Interview witnesses
- Assess evidence
- Get legal opinion

**2. Is no-contest clause in trust?**
- Review trust document
- Check all amendments
- Confirm current version

**3. What do you stand to lose?**
- How much are you left in trust?
- What would you forfeit?
- Is contest worth risk?

**4. What could you gain?**
- If trust invalidated, what do you receive?
- Prior trust terms
- Intestacy share
- Cost-benefit analysis

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Example calculation:**

**Current trust leaves you:** $100,000

**Prior trust would give you:** $500,000

**If contest successful:** Gain $400,000

**If no probable cause found:** Lose $100,000

**Attorney assessment:** 70% chance probable cause

**Analysis:**
- Expected value: ($400K × 70%) - ($100K × 30%) = $280K - $30K = $250K
- **Worth pursuing** if probable cause likely

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**How to reduce risk:**

**1. Get legal opinion**
- Attorney letter stating probable cause exists
- Shows good faith
- Evidence of reasonableness

**2. Mediate first**
- Attempt settlement before filing
- Show good faith efforts
- May avoid triggering clause

**3. Request court determination**
- Petition court for determination of probable cause
- Before filing contest
- Certainty before risking forfeiture

**4. Settlement with waiver**
- Negotiate settlement including waiver of no-contest clause
- All parties agree
- Safe from forfeiture

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Strong Probable Cause

**Facts:**
- Mother diagnosed with dementia
- Medical records clearly document progression
- Trust amended during late stage
- Amendment benefits caregiver
- Prior trust benefited children equally

**Analysis:**
- Clear probable cause
- Medical evidence strong
- Contest won't trigger no-contest clause
- **Safe to contest**

### Scenario 2: Weak Case

**Facts:**
- Father mentally competent
- Trust prepared with attorney
- Logical provisions
- No evidence of undue influence
- Contestant just thinks it's unfair

**Analysis:**
- No probable cause
- Would trigger no-contest clause
- **Don't contest - will lose inheritance**

### Scenario 3: Gray Area

**Facts:**
- Mother age 88, some confusion
- No formal diagnosis
- Trust changed recently
- Benefits one child more
- Some suspicious circumstances

**Analysis:**
- Probable cause arguable
- Close call
- Get legal opinion
- Consider settlement
- **Risky to contest**

## Burden of Proof

### Who Proves What

**If contest filed:**

**Contestant must prove:**
- Grounds for invalidity (capacity, undue influence, etc.)

**Proponent must prove (if no-contest clause invoked):**
- No probable cause existed
- Contestant acted unreasonably
- Forfeiture should apply

**Burden on proponent** to prove no probable cause

## Judicial Determination of Probable Cause

### Pre-Contest Determination

**Option:** Petition court for determination before filing contest

**Process:**
1. File petition requesting probable cause determination
2. Present evidence you've gathered
3. Court evaluates whether probable cause exists
4. Court issues ruling

**Benefits:**
- Know risk before contesting
- If probable cause found, safe to proceed
- If not found, can decide not to contest

**Downside:**
- Tips hand to opponent
- Reveals evidence early
- Additional legal fees

### Post-Contest Determination

**More common:**
- File contest
- If no-contest clause invoked
- Court determines probable cause as part of contest

**Timing:** Usually decided before trial on contest merits

## Exceptions and Limitations

### What No-Contest Clauses Can't Do

**Cannot penalize:**
- Information requests (accounting, trust copy)
- Trustee removal petitions
- Good faith interpretation requests
- Settlement negotiations

**California law protects** these activities

### Multiple Beneficiaries

**If some contest, others don't:**
- Only contestants face forfeiture
- Non-contesting beneficiaries unaffected
- Can create family divisions

### Minors and Incompetents

**Special protection:**
- Guardians can contest on behalf of minors
- Conservators for incompetent adults
- Probable cause standard still applies
- But consider ward's best interests

## Drafting No-Contest Clauses

### For Estate Planning Attorneys

**Effective no-contest clauses:**

**Should include:**
- Clear forfeiture language
- What actions trigger clause
- Exceptions for reasonable inquiries
- Probable cause acknowledgment

**Should NOT:**
- Attempt to prohibit information requests
- Bar legitimate trustee challenges
- Violate public policy

**Example well-drafted clause:**

"If any beneficiary contests or attacks this trust or its provisions, or aids anyone in doing so, without probable cause (as defined by California law), that person shall receive nothing under this trust and shall be treated as having predeceased me. This clause shall not apply to requests for information, petitions for court instructions about trust interpretation, or petitions to remove a trustee."

## Conclusion

No-contest clauses in California trusts are enforceable only if the contest is brought without probable cause. This protection allows beneficiaries with legitimate concerns to challenge trusts without fear of disinheritance. Understanding probable cause, assessing your evidence, and consulting with an attorney before filing are essential to navigating no-contest clauses successfully.

**Key takeaways:**
