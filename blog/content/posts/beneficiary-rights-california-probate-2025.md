# Beneficiary Rights in California Probate: Your Complete Legal Guide (2025)

If you're named as a beneficiary in a California will or trust, you have significant legal rights during the probate process. Unfortunately, many beneficiaries don't know what rights they have - and some executors take advantage of this.

This comprehensive guide explains your rights as a California probate beneficiary, how to enforce them, and what to do if the executor isn't fulfilling their obligations.

## What Rights Do Beneficiaries Have in California Probate?

Under California Probate Code, beneficiaries have these fundamental rights:

### 1. Right to Notice

**You must receive notice of:**
- Petition for Probate filing (Probate Code 8110)
- Probate hearing date (at least 15 days advance notice)
- Executor appointment
- All significant probate actions
- Court hearings
- Final accounting and distribution

**Timing**: Notice of petition must be mailed at least 15 days before the hearing.

### 2. Right to Information and Accounting

**You can demand** (Probate Code 10950):
- Copy of the will
- Inventory of estate assets
- Formal accounting showing all transactions
- Bank statements and financial records
- Status updates on probate progress
- Explanation of executor decisions

**Important**: Executors MUST provide accounting when beneficiaries request it. Refusal is grounds for removal.

### 3. Right to Object

**You can object to:**
- Executor appointment (file written objection)
- Proposed sales of estate property
- Executor compensation requests
- Attorney fee requests
- Creditor claims
- Distribution proposals

### 4. Right to Copy of Will

Beneficiaries are entitled to receive a copy of the will being probated. Executor must provide this upon request.

### 5. Right to Contest Will

If you have legal standing, you can contest the will based on:
- Lack of testamentary capacity
- Undue influence
- Fraud or forgery
- Improper execution
- Later will exists

**Deadline**: Must contest before will admitted to probate OR within 120 days after admission (Probate Code 8226).

### 6. Right to Representation

**You can:**
- Hire your own probate attorney
- Have attorney appear at all hearings
- File petitions independently
- Protect your interests separate from executor

**Cost**: Usually paid from your inheritance share or by petition to estate.

### 7. Right to Timely Distribution

Executors must distribute inheritance within reasonable timeframes. While probate takes 9-18+ months, unreasonable delays are prohibited.

## How Long Does a Beneficiary Have to Wait for Inheritance?

**Typical California Timeline:**

- **Minimum**: 9 months (due to 4-month creditor period + administrative tasks)
- **Average**: 12-18 months for straightforward estates
- **Complex**: 2-4+ years with litigation, tax issues, or business interests

**Why the wait?**
1. Creditor claim period (minimum 4 months)
2. Estate debts must be paid first
3. Real estate sales (3-12 months if needed)
4. Tax returns filed
5. Final accounting prepared
6. Court approval obtained

**When Can You Get Partial Distribution?**

Executors with Independent Administration authority may make partial distributions if:
- Estate clearly has enough to pay all debts
- Distribution won't harm other beneficiaries
- Remaining beneficiaries consent
- Adequate reserves maintained

## Can a Beneficiary Demand an Accounting in California?

**YES - Absolutely!** This is one of your most important rights.

Under Probate Code Section 10950:
- Any beneficiary can demand accounting at any time
- Executor must respond within 60 days
- Accounting must include all transactions
- Refusal is serious breach of duty

### What Must Be in the Accounting?

**Required information:**
- All assets received (with values)
- All income earned
- All expenses paid (with receipts/invoices)
- All distributions made
- Current value of remaining assets
- Gains/losses on investments
- Beginning and ending balances

### If Executor Refuses to Provide Accounting

You can:
1. Send formal written demand (certified mail)
2. File Petition to Compel Accounting
3. Request court hearing
4. Petition to remove executor
5. Recover your attorney fees from estate

**Court's Response**: Judges take accounting demands seriously. Executors who refuse face removal and surcharge.

## What If Executor Is Not Communicating With Beneficiaries?

**This is a common problem.** Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Document Everything

- Keep copies of all letters/emails to executor
- Note dates of requests
- Save returned receipts
- Track all communication attempts

### Step 2: Send Formal Written Request

**Include:**
- Your name and address
- Relationship to deceased
- Specific information requested
- Reference to Probate Code 10950 (accounting right)
- Deadline for response (30 days)
- Statement you'll petition court if no response

**Send via**: Certified mail, return receipt requested

### Step 3: Review Public Court File

Visit courthouse and review probate file:
- See what executor has filed
- Review inventories
- Check accounting filed
- Review court orders

**LA County**: Files available at Stanley Mosk Courthouse (downtown) or Glendale Courthouse

### Step 4: Hire Attorney and Petition Court

File petition for:
- Order compelling communication
- Order compelling accounting
- Removal of executor
- Your attorney fees paid from estate

**Grounds for Removal:**
- Failure to perform duties
- Failure to account
- Failure to communicate
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Mismanagement

## Can an Executor Ignore a Beneficiary?

**NO.** Executors owe fiduciary duties to ALL beneficiaries, including:

### Duty of Loyalty
- Act in beneficiaries' best interests
- No self-dealing
- No conflicts of interest
- Treat all beneficiaries fairly

### Duty of Care
- Manage assets prudently
- Preserve estate property
- Make reasonable decisions
- Avoid unnecessary risks

### Duty to Inform
- Keep beneficiaries reasonably informed
- Respond to reasonable inquiries
- Provide requested information
- Explain significant decisions

**Violation Consequences:**
- Removal from position
- Surcharge (personal liability for losses)
- Denial of compensation
- Payment of beneficiaries' attorney fees

## How Long Does Executor Have to Notify Beneficiaries?

California law sets strict notice requirements:

**Timeline:**
- **15 days before probate hearing**: Notice of Petition to Administer Estate
- **Within 90 days of letters**: Mail Duties and Liabilities form (DE-147)
- **Within 4 months of letters**: Inventory and Appraisal
- **As needed**: Notice of all significant proposed actions

**Failure to provide proper notice:**
- Delays proceedings
- Restarts statutory periods
- Can result in removal
- May create personal liability

## Beneficiary Rights When Executor Selling Property

When executor wants to sell estate real estate:

### With Independent Administration (IAEA):

**You receive:**
- 15-day Notice of Proposed Action (Form DE-165)
- Description of property and sale terms
- Proposed sale price and commission
- Right to object within 15 days

**You can:**
- Object to sale (forces court hearing)
- Argue price too low
- Question need for sale
- Propose alternative buyer

### Without IAEA:

**You receive:**
- Notice of petition for authority to sell
- Notice of hearing date
- Opportunity to appear and be heard

**You can:**
- Attend confirmation hearing
- Bid on property yourself
- Object to sale terms
- Challenge sale necessity

**Important**: Executor cannot sell to themselves or family below market value (self-dealing).

## Can Beneficiaries See the Will Before Probate?

**Yes and no:**

**Before probate filed:**
- Executor not legally obligated to show will
- But will becomes public once filed
- Beneficiaries can request informal viewing

**After probate filed:**
- Will becomes public record
- Anyone can view at courthouse
- Beneficiaries entitled to copy
- Executor should provide copy to named beneficiaries

## What If You're Not Named in the Will?

**Standing to contest depends on whether you:**
- Were named in prior will
- Would inherit under intestacy (no-will laws)
- Were omitted by mistake
- Are "pretermitted" (accidentally omitted) child/spouse

**Pretermitted Heirs** (Probate Code 21620):
- Children born after will signed
- May receive intestate share
- Must prove omission unintentional

## Do Beneficiaries Pay for Probate?

**Indirectly, yes.** All probate costs paid from estate before distribution:

**Typical Costs** (4-7% of estate):
- Attorney fees (statutory)
- Executor fees (statutory)
- Court filing fees
- Probate referee fees
- Accounting fees
- Bond (if required)

**This reduces inheritance amount.** Example:
- $500,000 estate
- $26,000 attorney + executor fees
- $3,000 other costs
- Beneficiaries receive: ~$471,000

**This is why living trusts are better** - avoid 4-7% probate costs.

## Protecting Yourself as a Beneficiary

**Smart beneficiary strategies:**

✓ Request copy of will immediately
✓ Review probate petition carefully
✓ Attend probate hearing
✓ Demand accounting every 6-12 months
✓ Keep detailed records
✓ Review court file regularly
✓ Communicate concerns in writing
✓ Hire attorney if executor unresponsive
✓ Know your deadlines (contest = 120 days)
✓ Don't rely on executor alone - verify

## Red Flags - When to Hire Attorney

**Get legal help if:**
- Executor won't communicate
- No accounting provided after request
- Suspicious transactions
- Assets "disappearing"
- Executor living in estate property rent-free
- Conflicts of interest
- Estate taking abnormally long
- Will seems suspicious
- You're being treated unfairly vs. other beneficiaries
- Executor using estate assets personally

## Common Beneficiary Questions

A: No. Must follow will. Only discretion is timing of distributions and estate management decisions.

**Q: What if I disagree with executor's decisions?**
A: Object via Notice of Proposed Action response or petition court.

**Q: Can I force executor to distribute now?**
A: Only if estate solvent and all requirements met. Can petition for partial distribution.

**Q: Do I have to accept inheritance?**
A: No. Can disclaim (refuse) inheritance within 9 months of death.

**Q: Can executor give himself a bonus?**
A: No. Only statutory fees unless court approves extraordinary compensation.
