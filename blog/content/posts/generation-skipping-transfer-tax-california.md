# Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax in Trust Administration California

The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GST tax) is one of the most complex areas of trust taxation. This 40% federal tax applies when assets transfer to grandchildren or more remote descendants, "skipping" a generation. Understanding GST tax is critical for trustees administering dynasty trusts or making distributions to skip persons.

This guide explains GST tax basics, exemptions, allocation strategies, and compliance requirements for California trustees.

## What Is GST Tax?

### Purpose

**Congress created GST tax to prevent:**
- Wealthy families from avoiding estate tax by skipping generations
- Leaving assets to grandchildren instead of children
- Creating perpetual dynasty trusts

### How It Works

**Tax triggers when property transfers to:**
- **Skip persons** (people 2+ generations younger than transferor)
- Typically grandchildren, great-grandchildren
- Non-relatives 37.5+ years younger

**Example without GST tax:**
- Father leaves $10M to grandson (skipping son's generation)
- Estate tax paid once
- Son's generation never taxed

**With GST tax:**
- Estate tax: 40% on $10M transfer to grandson
- GST tax: ADDITIONAL 40% on transfer
- **Combined 64% tax** (40% + (60% × 40%))

## GST Tax Rate

**Federal rate: 40%** (same as estate tax)

**California:** No state GST tax

**Effective rate:**
- 40% GST tax
- Plus estate tax if applicable
- Can exceed 60% combined

## Key Definitions

### Skip Person

**Who qualifies:**

**Direct descendants:**
- Grandchildren (2 generations below)
- Great-grandchildren (3+ generations below)

**Non-relatives:**
- Anyone 37.5+ years younger than transferor

**Trusts:**
- Trust where all beneficiaries are skip persons

### Non-Skip Person

**Who doesn't qualify:**
- Children (only 1 generation below)
- Spouse
- Anyone less than 37.5 years younger (non-relatives)

### Predeceased Parent Exception

**Important exception:**
Grandchild is NOT skip person if their parent (transferor's child) is already deceased.

**Example:**
- Grandfather creates trust
- Son dies before grandfather
- Grandson now moves up (not skip person)
- **No GST tax**

**Why:** Grandson essentially "replaces" his deceased father.

## Types of GST Events

### 1. Direct Skip

**Definition:** Outright transfer to skip person

**Examples:**
- Bequest to grandchild
- Gift to grandchild
- Distribution from trust to grandchild

**Tax due:** Immediately at transfer

**Who pays:** Transferor (or trust)

### 2. Taxable Termination

**Definition:** Trust interest terminates, skip persons remain

**Example:**
- Trust pays income to child (life)
- Then principal to grandchildren
- When child dies, taxable termination occurs
- **GST tax due on assets passing to grandchildren**

**Tax due:** At termination

**Who pays:** Trust

### 3. Taxable Distribution

**Definition:** Distribution from trust to skip person while non-skip person has interest

**Example:**
- Trust holds assets for child and grandchildren
- Trustee distributes $100,000 to grandchild
- **GST tax due on distribution**

**Tax due:** At distribution

**Who pays:** Usually recipient (grandchild)

## GST Tax Exemption

### Current Exemption (2024)

**$13.61 million per person** (indexed for inflation)

**Married couple:** $27.22 million combined

**Same as estate tax exemption**

### How Exemption Works

**Allocate exemption to transfers:**
- Can apply to gifts during life
- Can apply to transfers at death
- Once allocated, permanent
- Protects transfer from GST tax

**Example:**
- Create $5M trust for grandchildren
- Allocate $5M GST exemption
- Trust grows to $20M
- **No GST tax ever** (exemption shields all growth)

**This is why early allocation is powerful.**

### Inclusion Ratio

**Formula:**
Inclusion Ratio = 1 - (GST Exemption Allocated / Transfer Value)

**What it means:**
- 0 = Fully exempt (no GST tax)
- 1 = Fully taxable (40% GST tax)
- 0.5 = Half exempt (20% GST tax)

**Example 1:**
- $10M transfer
- $10M exemption allocated
- Inclusion ratio = 1 - ($10M / $10M) = 0
- **No GST tax**

**Example 2:**
- $10M transfer
- $5M exemption allocated
- Inclusion ratio = 1 - ($5M / $10M) = 0.5
- **GST tax = 40% × 0.5 = 20%**

## Dynasty Trusts

### What They Are

**Dynasty trust:**
- Trust lasting multiple generations
- Can last 90 years in California (Rule Against Perpetuities)
- Some states allow perpetual trusts

**Purpose:**
- Keep wealth in family
- Provide for multiple generations
- Protect from creditors and divorce
- Minimize estate taxes

### GST Tax Planning for Dynasty Trusts

**Key strategy:**
Allocate full GST exemption at creation

**Example:**
- Create $13M dynasty trust
- Allocate full $13M GST exemption
- Trust grows to $50M over 50 years
- Pays grandchildren, great-grandchildren
- **Zero GST tax on any distributions**

**Why this works:**
- Exemption shields original transfer
- All growth also shielded
- No GST tax for generations

## GST Tax in Trust Administration

### Trustee Responsibilities

**Must:**
1. Determine if trust subject to GST tax
2. Track GST exemption allocation
3. Calculate inclusion ratio
4. Report GST events on Form 709
5. Pay GST tax if due
6. Maintain records

### When Trusts Face GST Tax

**Common scenarios:**

**1. Trust created without GST exemption:**
- Settlor didn't allocate at creation
- Trust now faces GST tax

**2. Exemption partially allocated:**
- Inclusion ratio between 0 and 1
- Some distributions taxable

**3. Taxable termination:**
- Non-skip beneficiary dies
- Only skip persons remain

### Calculating GST Tax Due

**Formula:**
GST Tax = Transfer Amount × Inclusion Ratio × 40%

**Example:**
- $1M distribution to grandchild
- Inclusion ratio: 0.6
- GST tax = $1M × 0.6 × 40% = $240,000

### Who Pays GST Tax

**Depends on type:**

| GST Event | Who Pays |
|-----------|----------|
| Direct skip | Transferor or trust |
| Taxable termination | Trust |
| Taxable distribution | Recipient (can be different) |

**Trust usually pays from principal.**

## Form 709 Filing

### When Required

**File Form 709 (Gift Tax Return) if:**
- Direct skip occurs
- Allocating GST exemption
- Taxable distribution or termination over $18,000

**Deadline:** April 15 following year of transfer

**Extension:** Automatic 6-month extension with Form 4868

### What to Report

**Form 709 includes:**
- Part 1: Gifts subject to gift tax
- Part 2: GST tax calculation
- Part 3: GST exemption allocation
- Schedule A: Gifts

**For GST:**
- Description of transfer
- Value of transfer
- GST exemption allocated
- Inclusion ratio calculation
- GST tax due

### Automatic Allocation Rules

**IRS automatically allocates GST exemption to:**
- Direct skips
- Indirect skips to GST trusts

**Unless you opt out** on timely filed Form 709

**Why opt out:**
- Want to allocate to different transfer
- Preserve exemption
- Have better use for exemption

## Strategies to Minimize GST Tax

### 1. Allocate Exemption Early

**Benefit:**
- Shields future growth
- $1M exemption today protects $10M in 30 years

**Action:**
- File Form 709 timely
- Allocate to trusts with highest growth potential

### 2. Use Annual Exclusion

**$18,000 per recipient (2024)**
- Can gift to grandchildren GST-free
- Doesn't use GST exemption
- Must be outright gifts (no trust)

### 3. Pay Education/Medical Expenses

**Unlimited exclusion:**
- Pay directly to institution
- No GST tax
- No gift tax
- Doesn't use exemption

**Must pay directly** - can't reimburse grandchild.

### 4. Create Multiple Trusts

**Separate trusts:**
- Exempt trust (full exemption allocated)
- Non-exempt trust (no exemption)

**Benefit:**
- Maximize use of exemption
- Flexibility in distributions

### 5. Leverage Dynasty Trusts

**Maximum benefit:**
- Allocate full exemption at creation
- Trust lasts multiple generations
- All growth protected

### 6. Use Spousal Access Trusts

**SLAT (Spousal Lifetime Access Trust):**
- Irrevocable trust for spouse
- Children/grandchildren remainder beneficiaries
- Allocate GST exemption
- Remove from estate but maintain indirect access

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Allocating Exemption

**Problem:**
- Create trust for grandchildren
- Forget to allocate GST exemption on Form 709
- Trust faces 40% GST tax on distributions

**Solution:** File Form 709 timely allocating exemption.

### 2. Late Allocation

**Problem:**
- Wait years to allocate
- Trust appreciated significantly
- Exemption allocates at current (higher) value
- Wastes exemption

**Solution:** Allocate immediately at trust creation.

### 3. Partial Allocation

**Problem:**
- Allocate only partial exemption
- Inclusion ratio between 0 and 1
- Still face some GST tax

**Solution:** Allocate full exemption or split into separate trusts.

### 4. Missing Form 709 Deadline

**Problem:**
- Miss April 15 deadline
- Lose ability to allocate exemption for that year
- Or face late filing penalties

**Solution:** File timely or extension.

### 5. Ignoring Predeceased Parent Exception

**Problem:**
- Treat grandchild as skip person
- Pay GST tax unnecessarily
- Parent was already deceased

**Solution:** Check family tree for predeceased parents.

### 6. Not Tracking Inclusion Ratio

**Problem:**
- Don't know trust's inclusion ratio
- Can't calculate GST tax on distributions
- Records incomplete

**Solution:** Maintain clear records from trust creation.
