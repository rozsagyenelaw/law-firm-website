"The court appointed a probate referee to appraise my father's estate. What does this mean and how much will it cost?"

As a Glendale probate attorney, I explain probate referees to every client because they're a mandatory—and often misunderstood—part of California probate. Probate referees are court-appointed appraisers who determine the fair market value of estate assets for the official inventory.

Understanding what probate referees do, why they're required, how much they cost (0.1% of appraised value), and how their valuations affect probate helps executors navigate this required step.

This comprehensive guide explains everything about California probate referees: their role, appointment process, what assets they appraise, how appraisals are conducted, fees, timeline, challenging appraisals, and how valuations impact probate costs and taxes.

## What Is a Probate Referee?

**California Probate Code Sections 8900-8929**

**Probate referee:** A professional appraiser appointed by the court to determine the fair market value of estate assets for probate purposes.

### Purpose of Probate Referees

**Required for:**
- Completing inventory and appraisal (Form DE-160)
- Establishing official estate value
- Calculating statutory probate fees
- Determining estate tax liability
- Setting minimum sale prices for real property

**Why court-appointed:**
- Ensures independent, unbiased valuations
- Protects beneficiaries from undervaluation
- Protects creditors from overvaluation
- Provides official values for legal purposes

### Who Can Be a Probate Referee

**Requirements:**

**Qualifications (California Probate Code Section 8901):**
- Designated by court as probate referee for that county
- Qualified by education and experience
- Covered by fidelity bond
- Good moral character
- Not related to case parties

**Cannot serve if:**
- Interested in estate
- Related to decedent, executor, or beneficiaries
- Has conflict of interest

## When Are Probate Referees Required?

### Mandatory Appointment

**Probate referee required** in all formal probate proceedings in California.

**Exception:** Small estate procedures (under $184,500) don't require probate referee.

### Timing of Appointment

**Appointed early in probate:**
1. Executor files petition for probate
2. Court grants petition and issues letters
3. **Court appoints probate referee at same time**
4. Referee notified of appointment

**Executor doesn't choose** - court assigns referee.

### What Triggers the Appraisal

**Within 4 months of letters issued:**

**Executor must:**
- File inventory and appraisal (Form DE-160)
- List all estate assets
- State values for certain assets
- Send inventory to probate referee for appraisal

**Referee appraises** assets requiring appraisal (not all assets).

## What Do Probate Referees Appraise?

### Assets Referee DOES Appraise

**Real property:**
- Houses, condos, land
- Commercial property
- Rental property
- Undeveloped land
- Out-of-state real property

**Personal property:**
- Vehicles (cars, boats, RVs, motorcycles)
- Business interests
- Partnership interests
- Stock in closely-held corporations
- Tangible personal property (furniture, jewelry, art, collectibles)
- Machinery and equipment
- Intellectual property rights

**Generally:** Assets without readily ascertainable values.

### Assets Referee Does NOT Appraise

**Executor states values (not referee):**

**Cash assets:**
- Bank account balances (as of date of death)
- Certificates of deposit
- Money market accounts

**Publicly traded securities:**
- Stocks listed on major exchanges
- Bonds
- Mutual funds
- **Value:** Mean between high/low on date of death

**Life insurance:**
- If payable to estate
- **Value:** Policy proceeds

**Retirement accounts:**
- If payable to estate (rare)
- **Value:** Account balance at death

**Accounts with POD/TOD:**
- Usually don't go through probate
- Not included in probate inventory

**Why executor values these:** Values are readily ascertainable from statements or published prices.

## The Appraisal Process

### Step 1: Executor Prepares Inventory

**Executor completes Inventory and Appraisal form (DE-160):**

**Lists all assets:**
- Real property (addresses)
- Personal property (descriptions)
- Cash and securities (with values)
- Business interests
- Other assets

**Executor states values** for cash, publicly traded securities, and cash equivalents.

**Leaves blank** values for assets requiring referee appraisal.

### Step 2: Executor Sends Inventory to Referee

**After listing assets:**
- Send copy of inventory to appointed probate referee
- Include property addresses for inspection
- Provide access for referee to inspect property
- Include relevant documents (deeds, business records, etc.)

**Timeline:** Should send promptly to meet 4-month filing deadline.

### Step 3: Referee Conducts Appraisals

**Referee's process:**

**For real property:**
- Reviews county records
- May conduct site inspection
- Reviews comparable sales
- Considers condition, location, market
- Determines fair market value as of date of death

**For personal property:**
- Inspects items if necessary
- Reviews market data
- Considers condition, age, demand
- Determines fair market value

**For business interests:**
- Reviews financial statements
- Analyzes business operations
- Considers market multiples
- May engage business valuation expert

**Standard:** Fair market value on date of death (price willing buyer would pay willing seller).

### Step 4: Referee Completes Appraisal

**Referee fills in values** on inventory form for appraised assets.

**Signs under penalty of perjury.**

**Returns completed form to executor.**

**Timeline:** Usually 1-3 weeks after receiving inventory.

### Step 5: Executor Files Inventory with Court

**Executor files completed Inventory and Appraisal** with probate court.

**Must be filed within 4 months** of letters being issued.

**Includes:**
- All assets listed
- Executor's values for certain assets
- Referee's appraisal values for other assets
- Total gross estate value

## Probate Referee Fees

**California Probate Code Section 8960**

### Fee Structure

**Referee compensation:** 0.1% (one-tenth of one percent) of total appraised value

**Calculated on:** Gross value of property appraised by referee (not entire estate)

**Examples:**
- Property appraised at $500,000 = $500 fee
- Property appraised at $1,000,000 = $1,000 fee
- Property appraised at $2,000,000 = $2,000 fee

### Who Pays Referee Fees

**Paid by estate** before distribution to beneficiaries.

**Executor responsibility** to ensure payment.

**Timing:** Paid after referee completes appraisal.

### Minimum and Maximum Fees

**Minimum fee:** None statutory, but referees typically charge minimum (e.g., $250-$500)

**Maximum fee:** 0.1% of appraised value (no statutory cap above percentage)

### What's NOT Included in Standard Fee

**Additional charges possible for:**
- Out-of-county property inspection
- Extraordinary services
- Complex valuations requiring special expertise
- Multiple property locations

**These require court approval** if exceeding standard 0.1%.

## How Referee Valuations Affect Probate

### 1. Statutory Probate Fees

**Executor and attorney fees** calculated based on gross estate value.

**Higher appraisals = Higher fees**

**Example:**
- House appraised at $900,000 vs. $1,100,000
- Difference: $200,000
- Impact on fees: $200,000 × 2% = $4,000 additional executor fees + $4,000 additional attorney fees = $8,000 total

**Beneficiaries may have interest** in lower appraisals.
**Executor/attorney may have interest** in higher appraisals (more fees).

**Referee's duty:** Independent, accurate valuation regardless of fee impact.

### 2. Minimum Sale Price for Real Property

**If real property sold during probate:**

**Without IAEA authority:**
- Court confirmation required
- Minimum acceptable offer: 90% of appraised value

**Example:**
- House appraised at $1,000,000
- Cannot accept offer below $900,000 without court approval

**Higher appraisal** = Higher minimum sale price

### 3. Estate Tax Threshold

**Federal estate tax exemption:** $13.61 million (2024)

**Accurate valuation necessary** for estates approaching threshold.

**California:** No state estate tax

### 4. Basis Step-Up for Beneficiaries

**Beneficiaries receive property** with basis stepped up to date of death value.

**Higher appraisal** = Higher basis = Lower capital gains tax when beneficiaries eventually sell

**This usually benefits beneficiaries.**

## Challenging Probate Referee Appraisals

### When to Challenge

**Consider challenging if:**
- Appraisal significantly differs from market value
- Referee didn't inspect property
- Referee lacked expertise for asset type
- Recent sale price differs substantially
- Other appraisals show different value

### How to Challenge

**Process:**

**1. Obtain independent appraisal**
- Hire separate professional appraiser
- Get written appraisal report
- Must be credible and well-supported

**2. File objection with court**
- Petition objecting to referee appraisal
- Provide independent appraisal
- Explain why referee's value is incorrect

**3. Court hearing**
- Present evidence
- Referee may defend appraisal
- Judge determines correct value

**Burden:** Party challenging appraisal must prove referee's value is incorrect.

### Supplemental Inventory

**If assets discovered after original inventory:**

**File supplemental inventory and appraisal:**
- Lists newly discovered assets
- Sent to probate referee for appraisal
- Filed with court
- Additional referee fee applies

## Special Situations

### Out-of-State Property

**California probate referee appraises** out-of-state real property for California probate.

**May rely on:**
- Local appraisals
- Market data from property state
- Remote valuation methods

**Separate ancillary probate** may be required in property's state.

### Complex Business Valuations

**Closely-held businesses may require:**
- Business valuation expert
- Financial analysis
- Goodwill assessment
- Multiple valuation methods

**Referee may:**
- Engage business valuation specialist
- Charge additional fees (with court approval)
- Request business records from executor

### Property Sold Before Inventory

**If property sold between death and inventory:**

**Two values possible:**
1. **Fair market value at death** (what referee appraises)
2. **Actual sale price** (what property sold for)

**Referee uses date-of-death value,** not sale price.

**Sale price used** only if sale was arm's length transaction close to death date.

### Date of Death vs. Alternate Valuation

**Standard:** Date of death valuation

**Alternate valuation date:** Six months after death (for estate tax purposes only)

**Probate referee uses date of death** for probate inventory.

## Working With Probate Referees

### Executor's Responsibilities

**To facilitate appraisal:**

**Provide information:**
- Property addresses
- Access to inspect property
- Relevant documents (deeds, financial statements)
- Answer referee's questions

**Coordinate timing:**
- Send inventory promptly
- Allow time for appraisal before 4-month deadline
- Arrange property access

**Don't:**
- Try to influence valuation
- Withhold information
- Pressure referee for certain value

### Communication

**Appropriate contact:**
- Provide factual information
- Answer questions about property
- Coordinate logistics

**Inappropriate contact:**
- Suggesting specific values
- Offering inducements
- Threatening referee

**Referee is independent** and owes duties to court, not parties.
