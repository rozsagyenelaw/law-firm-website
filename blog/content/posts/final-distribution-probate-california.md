After months of probate administration—paying debts, selling property, filing tax returns—executors finally reach the finish line: final distribution. This is when beneficiaries actually receive their inheritance and the estate is officially closed.

As a Glendale probate attorney who guides executors through hundreds of final distributions, I know that properly closing an estate requires careful attention to detail. Skipping steps or distributing assets prematurely can result in personal liability for the executor.

This comprehensive guide explains the complete final distribution process in California probate: when you're ready to distribute, final accounting requirements, petition for distribution procedures, the distribution hearing, transferring assets to beneficiaries, obtaining receipts, closing estate accounts, and formal discharge as executor.

## When Is Estate Ready for Final Distribution?

**Before distributing, executor must complete ALL duties:**

### Prerequisites for Distribution

**✓ Creditor claim period expired** (minimum 4 months from letters)

**✓ All creditor claims resolved**
- Allowed claims paid
- Rejected claims either settled or barred

**✓ All debts and expenses paid**
- Funeral expenses
- Administration costs
- Taxes
- Final bills

**✓ All taxes filed and paid**
- Final income tax return (decedent)
- Estate income tax returns (Form 1041)
- Estate tax return (if required)
- All tax clearances obtained

**✓ Property sold (if applicable)**
- Real estate sales completed
- Proceeds in estate account
- Escrow closed

**✓ All assets converted to distributable form**

- Assets in executor's possession
- Ready for transfer

**✓ All required notices given**
- Beneficiaries notified of impending distribution
- Creditors given final notice

**Timing:** Typically 12-18 months after probate opened.

**Rushing distribution before completing these steps = Executor liability**

## Final Accounting

**California Probate Code Sections 10900-10954**

### What Is Final Accounting?

**Comprehensive financial report** showing everything that happened during probate:

**Must include:**

1. **Opening inventory** (assets at start)

3. **All expenses paid** (debts, taxes, administration costs)
4. **Property sold and sale terms**
5. **Assets remaining for distribution**
6. **Proposed distribution plan**

**Purpose:** Shows beneficiaries and court exactly what happened to estate assets.

## Distributing Assets to Beneficiaries

### Timing

- Can distribute immediately if all beneficiaries consent to waive appeal period

### Methods of Distribution

**Cash distributions:**
1. Write checks from estate account
2. Wire transfer funds
3. Deliver cashier's checks

**Real property:**
1. Prepare executor's deed
2. Reference court order
3. Record with county recorder
4. Deliver recorded deed to beneficiary

**Securities (stocks, bonds):**
1. Transfer to beneficiary's brokerage account
2. Or liquidate and distribute cash
3. Transfer agent instructions

**Personal property:**

2. Prepare receipts
3. Take photos of delivery

**Vehicles:**

2. File with DMV
3. Provide court order if needed

### Documenting Distributions

**Critical:** Get signed receipt from each beneficiary.

**Receipt should state:**
- Beneficiary name
- Description of property received
- Date received
- Acknowledgment it's their full inheritance
- Release of executor from further liability
- Signature

**Example:**
"I, [Beneficiary Name], acknowledge receipt of [describe property] representing my full inheritance from the estate of [Decedent Name]. I release the executor from any further liability regarding this estate."

**Keep receipts permanently** - proof executor completed duties.

### Partial Distributions

**Sometimes distribute in stages:**

**Partial distribution before final:**
- After creditor period
- Before all administration complete
- With court approval
- Reserve sufficient funds for remaining expenses

**Final distribution:**
- After all duties complete
- Remainder of assets
- Close estate accounts

### Special Situations

**Minor beneficiaries:**
- Cannot receive inheritance directly
- Must establish blocked account at bank
- Court order required
- Guardian manages until age 18
- Or establish guardianship of estate

**Beneficiaries with special needs:**
- Consider special needs trust
- Protect government benefits
- May require court approval

**Unknown whereabouts:**
- Make reasonable efforts to locate
- File with court if cannot locate
- May escheat to state after period

**Disputed distributions:**
- Hold funds pending resolution
- Seek court guidance
- May require separate litigation

## Tax Considerations

### Income Tax Reporting

**Beneficiaries receive Schedule K-1** showing:
- Their share of estate income
- Their distributive share
- Tax character of distributions

**Most distributions tax-free** (basis step-up at death).

**But estate income during probate is taxable** to beneficiaries when distributed.

### Estate Tax Clearance

**If estate tax return filed:**
- Obtain closing letter from IRS
- Shows estate tax paid or none due
- Protects executor from later claims

**May take 6-12 months** for IRS to issue.

**Can distribute before receiving** if estate tax clearly paid or not applicable.

### Property Tax Issues

**Real property transfer may trigger reassessment.**

**Beneficiaries should know:**
- Property taxes may increase
- File for parent-child exemption if eligible (Prop 19)
- New assessed value based on current market

## Closing Estate Accounts

### Bank Accounts

**After all distributions:**
1. Verify all checks cleared
2. Transfer any remaining interest to final account
3. Close estate accounts
4. Obtain final statements

**Timing:** Don't close too early - need to ensure all obligations paid.

### Investment Accounts

1. Transfer securities to beneficiaries
2. Liquidate remaining positions
3. Distribute final proceeds
4. Close accounts

### Credit Cards

1. Cancel estate credit cards
2. Pay final bills
3. Close accounts

### Utilities and Services

1. Transfer to beneficiary (if keeping property)
2. Cancel services (if property sold)
3. Pay final bills
4. Close accounts

## Executor Discharge

**California Probate Code Section 12200**

### What Is Discharge?

**Formal release** of executor from:
- Further duties
- Personal liability
- Bond obligations

**Occurs:** Automatically 30 days after order approving final account (unless appeal filed).

### Effect of Discharge

**Executor:**
- No longer has authority to act
- Released from bond
- Liability limited to accounting period
- Can be surcharged only for disclosed matters

**Does not eliminate liability** for fraud, concealment, or undisclosed misconduct.

### Final Report and Petition for Discharge

**Sometimes separate document** requesting:
- Court finding all duties completed
- Formal discharge order
- Exoneration of surety

**Judge signs:** Final order discharging executor.

## Common Final Distribution Problems

### Problem: Beneficiary Won't Sign Receipt

**Solution:**
- Explain receipt doesn't waive valid claims
- Note in records beneficiary received distribution
- May need court order confirming distribution made

### Problem: Insufficient Funds for All Debts

**Insolvent estate requires:**
- Pay in statutory priority order
- Prorate within each priority class
- Get court approval for distribution plan

### Problem: Disputed Distribution Amount

**Options:**
- Mediation
- File interpleader (deposit with court)
- Seek court determination
- Hold disputed amount pending resolution

### Problem: Property Can't Be Divided

**Real estate to multiple beneficiaries:**
- Sell and divide proceeds, OR
- Award to one with cash equalization, OR
- Create co-ownership (least recommended)

### Problem: Estate Ran Out of Money

**If administration costs exceeded assets:**
- Petitioner may have advanced costs
- May seek reimbursement from beneficiaries
- Usually no recovery available

## How Long Does Final Distribution Take?

**From filing final accounting to distribution:**

**Uncontested:**
- File accounting and petition: Day 1
- Hearing scheduled: 4-6 weeks
- Order signed: Same day as hearing
- Order becomes final: 30 days after signing
- Distributions made: Days after final
- **Total: 2-3 months**

**Contested:**
- Objections filed: Extends timeline
- Evidentiary hearing: +2-6 months
- Resolution or trial: +6-12 months
- **Total: 8-18+ months**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can executor distribute before all taxes filed?

Risky. Should wait for tax clearances to avoid personal liability if additional taxes later assessed.

### What if beneficiary refuses to accept inheritance?

Beneficiary can "disclaim" (refuse) inheritance. Must be in writing within 9 months. Property passes as if beneficiary predeceased.

### Can beneficiaries agree to different distribution than will provides?

Yes, if all agree in writing. Court must approve compromise.

### What if executor made mistakes in accounting?

File corrected accounting before distribution. Disclose errors to beneficiaries. May be surcharged if mistakes caused losses.

### How long must executor keep records?

Permanently advisable, minimum 7 years. Beneficiaries could challenge years later.

### Can executor be sued after discharge?

For fraud or concealment, yes. For disclosed matters in approved accounting, no (absent fraud).
