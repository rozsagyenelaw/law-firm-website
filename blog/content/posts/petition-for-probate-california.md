The Petition for Probate (Form DE-111) is the legal document that initiates probate proceedings in California. This single form opens the probate case, requests appointment as executor or administrator, and sets the entire probate process in motion.

As a Glendale probate attorney who files dozens of these petitions every year, I know that properly completing Form DE-111 is critical—errors or omissions can result in the petition being rejected, delaying the entire probate by weeks or months.

This comprehensive guide explains everything about filing a Petition for Probate in California: who can file, required information, step-by-step form instructions, supporting documents needed, filing procedures, the court hearing, and what happens after the petition is granted.

## What Is a Petition for Probate?

**Judicial Council Form DE-111:** Petition for Probate

**Purpose:** Formal request to probate court to:
- Open probate case
- Admit will to probate (if one exists)
- Appoint executor (if will names one) or administrator (if no will)

**This is the first step** in formal California probate.

### When Petition for Probate Is Required

**Required when:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I make a mistake on the petition?

Can file amended petition or correct at hearing if minor error. Serious errors may require re-filing.

### What if nobody wants to be executor?

Public Administrator will be appointed to handle estate. Not ideal but available as last resort.

### How much does it cost to file?

Filing fee $435-$935 based on estate value. Attorney fees additional (typically $3,000-$10,000 to prepare and file petition).

### What if decedent had property in multiple counties?
