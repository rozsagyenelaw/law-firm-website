One of the first questions people ask after being named executor is: "How much do I get paid?"

California law provides a clear answer: executors are entitled to statutory fees based on the gross value of the estate. For a $1 million estate, the executor fee is $23,000. For a $2 million estate, it's $43,000.

As a Glendale probate attorney who regularly advises executors, I've seen many people surprised by both how compensation works and the strategic decision of whether to take the fee or waive it.

This comprehensive guide explains exactly how California executor fees are calculated, the statutory fee schedule, when executors can request extraordinary compensation, tax implications of taking fees, and the strategic analysis of whether to waive compensation.

## California's Statutory Executor Fee Schedule

**California Probate Code Section 10800** establishes statutory fees that executors are entitled to receive.

**The fees are NOT negotiable—they're set by law.**

### How Statutory Fees Are Calculated

Executor compensation is based on the **gross value of the estate** before debts.

**Gross estate** means:
- Total value of all probate assets
- Before mortgages and debts are subtracted
- Appraised value, not equity

**Example:**
House worth $800,000 with $500,000 mortgage = $800,000 counted for fee purposes (not $300,000 equity).

### California Executor Fee Schedule

| Gross Estate Value | Executor Fee |
|-------------------|--------------|
| First $100,000 | 4% = $4,000 |
| Next $100,000 | 3% = $3,000 |
| Next $800,000 | 2% = $16,000 |
| Next $9,000,000 | 1% = up to $90,000 |
| Next $15,000,000 | 0.5% = up to $75,000 |
| Above $25,000,000 | "Reasonable amount" determined by court |

### Fee Calculation Examples

**$500,000 Estate:**
- First $100K: $4,000 (4%)
- Next $100K: $3,000 (3%)
- Next $300K: $6,000 (2%)
- **Total fee: $13,000**

**$1,000,000 Estate:**
- First $100K: $4,000
- Next $100K: $3,000
- Next $800K: $16,000
- **Total fee: $23,000**

**$2,000,000 Estate:**
- First $100K: $4,000
- Next $100K: $3,000
- Next $800K: $16,000
- Next $1M: $10,000 (1%)
- **Total fee: $33,000**

**$5,000,000 Estate:**
- First $100K: $4,000
- Next $100K: $3,000
- Next $800K: $16,000
- Next $4M: $40,000 (1%)
- **Total fee: $63,000**

### Quick Reference Fee Chart

| Estate Value | Statutory Executor Fee |
|-------------|----------------------|
| $250,000 | $9,000 |
| $500,000 | $13,000 |
| $750,000 | $18,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $23,000 |
| $1,500,000 | $28,000 |
| $2,000,000 | $33,000 |
| $3,000,000 | $43,000 |
| $5,000,000 | $63,000 |
| $10,000,000 | $113,000 |

## When Executor Fees Are Calculated

### Based on Final Inventory Value

Executor fees are calculated based on the **inventory and appraisal** value filed with the court.

**Timing:**
- Inventory filed within 4 months of letters issued
- Values determined by probate referee
- Fees calculated on these appraised values

### What's Included in Gross Estate

**Counted toward executor fees:**
- Real property (appraised value)
- Bank accounts
- Investment accounts
- Business interests
- Personal property
- Vehicles
- All probate assets

**NOT counted:**
- Joint tenancy property (passes outside probate)
- Life insurance with named beneficiary
- Retirement accounts with beneficiary
- Trust assets
- POD/TOD accounts
- Any non-probate assets

### Importance of Accurate Valuation

**Higher valuations = Higher fees**

**Example:**
House appraised at $900,000 vs. $1,100,000 = $4,000 difference in executor fee (2% of $200K difference).

Executors benefit from higher appraisals; beneficiaries benefit from lower appraisals (assuming no estate tax issues).

## How Executor Fees Are Paid

### From Estate Assets

Executor fees are paid from estate assets before distribution to beneficiaries.

**Not paid by executor personally.**

### Timing of Payment

**Two options:**

**Option 1: Advance payments**
- Executor can request periodic payments
- Court approval required
- Must file petition showing work performed
- Typical: After major milestones completed

**Option 2: Final payment**
- Most common approach
- Fees paid as part of final distribution
- Court approves in final accounting
- Single payment at end of probate

### Court Approval Required

**California Probate Code Section 10830**

Court must approve all executor compensation.

**Process:**
1. Executor files accounting showing fee calculation
2. Notice provided to beneficiaries
3. Court hearing
4. Judge approves fees
5. Executor receives payment

**Objections:** Beneficiaries can object if they believe fees are excessive or work wasn't performed.

## Extraordinary Fees

Beyond statutory fees, executors can request **extraordinary compensation** for unusual services.

**California Probate Code Section 10811**

### What Qualifies as Extraordinary

**Services outside ordinary executor duties:**

1. **Litigation**
   - Will contests
   - Creditor disputes
   - Beneficiary disputes
   - Defending estate lawsuits

2. **Business Operations**
   - Continuing decedent's business
   - Managing complex business interests
   - Business sales

3. **Tax Issues**
   - Complex estate tax returns
   - IRS audits
   - Tax litigation

4. **Real Estate Complexities**
   - Major property improvements
   - Environmental issues
   - Eviction proceedings
   - Property development

5. **Out-of-State Property**
   - Ancillary probate proceedings
   - Managing out-of-state assets

6. **Family Disputes**
   - Mediating complex family conflicts
   - Extensive communication with difficult beneficiaries

### How Extraordinary Fees Are Calculated

**No set formula.** Court determines "reasonable" compensation based on:

- Time spent
- Complexity of work
- Results achieved
- Value added to estate
- Hourly rates for similar services

**Typically:** $150-$400/hour depending on complexity and executor's expertise.

### Requesting Extraordinary Fees

**Process:**
1. Document extraordinary services performed
2. Track time spent (detailed records)
3. File petition for extraordinary compensation
4. Provide notice to beneficiaries
5. Court hearing
6. Judge determines appropriate amount

**Burden:** Executor must prove services were truly extraordinary and benefited estate.

## Can Executors Waive Their Fees?

**Yes.** Executors can waive compensation entirely or partially.

### Why Executors Waive Fees

**Tax Strategy (Most Common Reason)**

**Executor fees are taxable income to executor.**
**Inheritances are NOT taxable income to beneficiaries.**

**Example:**
Executor who is also beneficiary inheriting $500K.
Executor fee would be $13,000.

**Option 1: Take fee**
- Receive $13,000 as taxable income
- Pay ~$4,500 in taxes (35% bracket)
- Net benefit: $8,500

**Option 2: Waive fee**
- $13,000 added to estate assets
- Inherits $13,000 more as beneficiary
- $0 taxes on inheritance
- Net benefit: $13,000

**Savings by waiving: $4,500**

**When waiving makes sense:**
- Executor is also a beneficiary
- Executor is in high tax bracket
- Estate is solvent (no creditor issues)

**When waiving doesn't make sense:**
- Executor is not a beneficiary
- Executor needs income now
- Executor performed extraordinary work
- Beneficiaries are causing problems

### How to Waive Executor Fees

**California Probate Code Section 10800**

**Process:**
1. File written waiver with court
2. Include in final accounting
3. Court acknowledges waiver
4. Cannot later claim fees after waiving

**Timing:** Can waive at any time during probate or at final accounting.

**Partial waiver:** Can waive portion and take portion.

## Multiple Executors: How Fees Are Divided

**When multiple executors appointed:**

### Equal Division Default

**California Probate Code Section 10801**

Statutory fee is divided equally among executors unless court orders otherwise.

**Example:**
$1M estate, $23,000 fee, two executors:
- Each receives $11,500

### Unequal Division

Court can approve unequal division if:
- One executor did significantly more work
- Division is fair based on services rendered
- All executors agree to different split

**Petition required** to request unequal division.

### When One Executor Waives

If one executor waives fees, the other executor can receive the full statutory fee (not split).

**Example:**
Two executors. One waives fees, one takes fees.
- Waiving executor: $0
- Taking executor: Full $23,000 (for $1M estate)

## Compensation vs. Reimbursement

**Important distinction:**

### Executor Compensation

- **Statutory fees for services**
- **Taxable income**
- **Requires court approval**

### Expense Reimbursement

- **Repayment for money spent**
- **NOT taxable**
- **Routine reimbursements don't require court approval**

**Reimbursable expenses:**
- Certified copies of death certificate
- Postage
- Filing fees
- Appraisal fees
- Mileage (at IRS rate)
- Office supplies
- Storage costs
- Property maintenance
- Insurance premiums

**Keep detailed records and receipts.**

## Tax Implications of Executor Fees

### Executor Fees Are Taxable Income

**IRS and California Franchise Tax Board:**

Executor compensation is **ordinary income** subject to:
- Federal income tax
- California state income tax
- Self-employment tax (if executor is self-employed)

**Reported on:** Form 1040, Line 8 (Other Income)

**Estate issues:** Form 1099-MISC if fees exceed $600

### Tax Rates

Depends on executor's total income and tax bracket.

**Federal rates:** 10%-37%
**California rates:** 1%-13.3%
**Combined:** Up to 50.3% in highest brackets

**Example:**
$23,000 executor fee, 35% combined tax rate = $8,050 in taxes.

### Inheritances Are NOT Taxable

**Key point:** Money received as beneficiary is NOT taxable income.

**This creates the tax incentive to waive fees when executor is also beneficiary.**

### Deduction by Estate

**Estate can deduct executor fees** on estate's income tax return (Form 1041).

**But:** This only matters if estate has taxable income during administration.

**Most estates:** No significant income, so deduction has little value.

## Strategic Analysis: Should You Take Executor Fees?

### Decision Matrix

**TAKE FEES IF:**
- You're not a beneficiary
- You performed extensive work
- You need current income
- Beneficiaries were difficult
- You incurred opportunity costs

**WAIVE FEES IF:**
- You're a major beneficiary
- You're in high tax bracket
- You want to maximize inheritance
- Estate administration was straightforward
- Family harmony matters

### Calculation Example

**Scenario:**
- $1M estate, $23,000 executor fee
- Executor is 50% beneficiary
- Executor's tax rate: 35%

**Option 1: Take fee**
- Fee received: $23,000
- Taxes paid: $8,050 (35%)
- Net after tax: $14,950
- Inheritance: $488,500 (50% of $977K remaining)
- **Total received: $503,450**

**Option 2: Waive fee**
- Fee received: $0
- Taxes paid: $0
- Inheritance: $500,000 (50% of $1M)
- **Total received: $500,000**

**Wait, taking fee was better?**

**Actually, no.** This example ignores that executor already owned 50% of the fee:

**Corrected Option 1:**
- Net fee after tax: $14,950
- Cost to executor as beneficiary: $11,500 (50% of $23,000 lost from inheritance)
- **Net benefit: $3,450**

**Corrected Option 2:**
- Waive fee, inherit full share: $500,000
- No tax, no fee reduction
- **Net benefit: $0 fee taken, but inherited $11,500 more**

**Complex math,** but general rule: **If you're a significant beneficiary in a high tax bracket, waiving usually makes sense.**

### Get Professional Advice

**Consult CPA or tax attorney** before deciding whether to take or waive fees.

**Factors to analyze:**
- Your tax bracket
- Your percentage inheritance
- Alternative minimum tax implications
- State tax implications
- Estate's tax situation

## Special Situations

### Professional Executors

**Banks, trust companies, professional fiduciaries:**

- Entitled to statutory fees
- Rarely waive fees (it's their business)
- May charge hourly rates if will permits
- Professional fees often higher than statutory

### Attorney-Executors

**If attorney serves as executor:**

**Cannot receive both:**
- Statutory executor fees AND
- Attorney fees for same work

**Must choose:**
- Executor compensation for executor duties
- Attorney fees for legal work
- Combination (allocating appropriately)

**California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8.11** governs attorney conflicts.

### Out-of-State Executors

**Entitled to same statutory fees as in-state executors.**

**But:**
- May have higher expenses (travel)
- May request extraordinary fees for travel time
- May need local attorney (additional cost to estate)

### Successor Executors

**If original executor:**
- Resigns
- Dies
- Is removed

**Successor executor:**
- Entitled to statutory fees
- Fees calculated on full estate value
- Even though original executor did some work
- Court may prorate if both did substantial work

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do executor fees come out of my inheritance?

Yes. Executor fees are paid from estate assets before distribution to beneficiaries, reducing what beneficiaries receive.

### Can the will specify different executor compensation?

Yes. Wills can provide for higher or lower compensation. But if will provides less than statutory fees, executor can petition court for statutory amount.

### What if beneficiaries think fees are too high?

Beneficiaries can object at court hearing. Court will review work performed and determine if fees are appropriate.

### Are executor fees the same as attorney fees?

No. Executor fees compensate the executor. Attorney fees compensate the probate attorney. Both are based on same percentage schedule, but they're separate fees.

### Can executor pay themselves without court approval?

No. All executor compensation requires court approval. Taking fees without approval can result in surcharge.

### What if executor did a bad job?

Court can reduce or deny fees if executor breached fiduciary duties or failed to properly perform duties.

### Can executor fees be negotiated?

Statutory fees cannot be negotiated—they're set by law. Extraordinary fees are subject to court determination of reasonableness.

### What if estate can't afford executor fees?

If estate is insolvent, executor may not receive full fees. Creditor claims have priority over executor compensation.
