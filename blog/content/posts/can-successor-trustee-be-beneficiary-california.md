You've been named as both successor trustee and beneficiary of a loved one's trust. Is that allowed? Can the same person manage the trust AND receive assets from it?

The short answer: Yes, absolutely. It's not only legal—it's extremely common. But it comes with important responsibilities and potential complications you should understand.

## Yes, It's Legal and Common

California law permits the same person to serve as both trustee and beneficiary. In fact, this is one of the most common arrangements in family trusts.

**Typical scenario:** A parent creates a living trust naming themselves as initial trustee. They name their adult child as both:

- Successor trustee (to manage the trust after the parent dies)
- Beneficiary (to receive assets from the trust)

This makes sense. Parents often want their children to both inherit their assets AND manage the distribution process.

## Why Families Choose This Arrangement

### Simplicity

One person handles administration without needing to coordinate with a separate trustee.

### Cost Savings

No need to pay a professional trustee when a trusted family member can serve.

### Trust and Confidence

The trust creator knew this person well and trusted them with both roles.

### Efficiency

The trustee-beneficiary can make decisions quickly without conflicts with an outside party.

## The Catch: Fiduciary Duties Still Apply

Here's what's critical: Even though you're entitled to receive trust assets, you must still act as a fiduciary toward ALL beneficiaries—including yourself.

This means you cannot favor yourself over other beneficiaries, even though you're one of them.

## Your Duties as Trustee (Even as Beneficiary)

### Duty of Impartiality

You must treat all beneficiaries fairly, including yourself. You cannot:

- Give yourself more than your share
- Take distributions before other beneficiaries
- Make decisions that benefit you at others' expense

### Duty of Loyalty

You must put the beneficiaries' collective interests first, not your personal interest in receiving more.

### Duty to Account

You must keep records and provide accountings to co-beneficiaries, showing exactly what happened to trust assets—including what you received.

### Duty to Follow Trust Terms

You distribute according to the trust document, not according to what you'd prefer.

## Potential Conflicts of Interest

Being both trustee and beneficiary creates inherent conflicts. Here are situations where problems arise:

### Conflict 1: Valuing Assets for Division

**Scenario:** The trust says you and your sibling each get 50% of the estate. The trust includes a house worth $800,000 and $200,000 in cash.

**The conflict:** If you take the house, it must be valued fairly. You might be tempted to undervalue it so you "owe" less equalization to your sibling.

**The solution:** Get an independent appraisal. Document fair market value objectively.

### Conflict 2: Deciding When to Sell Property

**Scenario:** You want to keep the family home and buy out your siblings. They want to sell immediately.

**The conflict:** As trustee, you control timing. As beneficiary, you have a personal preference.

**The solution:** Act as a trustee first—consider what's best for the trust and all beneficiaries, not just your preference. If you want to buy, make a fair offer at appraised value.

### Conflict 3: Setting Trustee Compensation

**Scenario:** The trust allows "reasonable" trustee compensation. You're doing the work—can you pay yourself?

**The conflict:** You're deciding your own salary from an estate you inherit from.

**The solution:** Keep compensation objectively reasonable. Document time spent. Consider what a professional would charge. Get other beneficiaries' consent if possible.

### Conflict 4: Exercising Discretion

**Scenario:** The trust gives you discretion to distribute income for beneficiaries' "health, education, and support." You're both trustee and a beneficiary.

**The conflict:** You're deciding how much to give yourself.

**The solution:** Apply the same standards you'd apply to other beneficiaries. Document your reasoning. Consider what an independent trustee would decide.

## How to Protect Yourself as Trustee-Beneficiary

### 1. Document Everything

Keep meticulous records of:

- Every decision you make and why
- How you valued assets
- Why distributions were made
- Time you spent on trustee duties
- Any compensation you took

If a co-beneficiary later challenges you, documentation is your defense.

### 2. Treat All Beneficiaries Equally

Apply the same rules to yourself that you apply to others:

- Same timeline for distributions
- Same valuation methods
- Same documentation requirements
- Same standards for discretionary decisions

### 3. Communicate Transparently

Keep other beneficiaries informed:

- Send regular updates
- Share accountings proactively
- Explain your decisions
- Respond promptly to questions

Suspicion grows in silence.

### 4. Get Independent Appraisals

For significant assets (especially real estate), get professional appraisals. Don't rely on your own estimates.

### 5. Consider Waiving Trustee Fees

Many family trustee-beneficiaries waive compensation to avoid conflicts and resentment. You'll receive your beneficiary share anyway.

### 6. Consult Professionals

An attorney and CPA can provide objective guidance—and documentation that you sought professional advice supports your good faith.

## When to Consider Declining One Role

Sometimes it's better NOT to serve as both trustee and beneficiary:

**Consider declining the trustee role if:**

- You have significant conflicts with co-beneficiaries
- The trust involves complex discretionary decisions
- Family relationships are already strained
- You don't have time to serve properly
- The responsibility feels overwhelming

You can still be a beneficiary even if you decline to serve as trustee. The next named successor takes over administration.

## What If Co-Beneficiaries Object?

Sometimes co-beneficiaries are uncomfortable with one beneficiary also controlling the trust.

**Their options:**

- Request detailed accountings
- Ask for independent appraisals
- Object to specific decisions
- Petition the court for removal (if you breach duties)
- Request court supervision of the trust

**Your protection:**

- Follow fiduciary duties carefully
- Document everything
- Communicate transparently
- Act in good faith
- Seek professional guidance

If you're doing everything properly, objections won't succeed.

## What the Trust Creator Intended

Remember: the person who created this trust specifically chose you for both roles. They trusted your integrity to:

- Manage their estate responsibly
- Treat all beneficiaries fairly
- Receive your inheritance appropriately

Honoring their trust means taking both roles seriously and acting with integrity.

## Common Questions

### Can I distribute my share to myself before others?

Not unless the trust specifically allows it. Generally, distribute proportionally or wait until full distribution to all beneficiaries.

### Can I buy trust property for myself?

Technically possible, but risky. If you buy trust property:

- Get an independent appraisal
- Pay fair market value
- Document everything
- Consider getting co-beneficiaries' written consent

### Can I be removed as trustee?

Yes. Co-beneficiaries can petition the court to remove you if you breach your fiduciary duties. But simply being a beneficiary is NOT grounds for removal.

### Should I hire an attorney even though I'm a beneficiary?

Yes. Professional guidance protects you as trustee AND ensures you properly receive your beneficiary share. The attorney fee comes from the trust, not your inheritance.
