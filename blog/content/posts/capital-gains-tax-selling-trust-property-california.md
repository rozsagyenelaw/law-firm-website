# Capital Gains Tax When Selling Trust Property California: Complete Tax Guide

When a trust sells property during administration, understanding capital gains tax is essential. The good news: most trust property receives a "stepped-up basis" at death, significantly reducing or eliminating capital gains. The bad news: trustees who don't understand these rules can trigger unnecessary taxes or make costly reporting mistakes.

This guide explains everything trustees need to know about capital gains tax when selling trust property in California.

## What Is Capital Gains Tax?

**Capital gain = Sale price - Basis - Selling costs**

**Tax rates (2024):**
- Short-term (held <1 year): Ordinary income rates (up to 37%)
- Long-term (held >1 year): 0%, 15%, or 20%
- Plus: 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax on undistributed gains
- California: Up to 13.3% additional state tax

## The Stepped-Up Basis Rule

### How It Works

**General rule:** Property inherited through a trust receives a new tax basis equal to its fair market value on the date of death.

**Example:**
- Settlor bought house in 1990 for $200,000
- Settlor dies in 2024, house worth $1,200,000
- **New basis: $1,200,000** (not $200,000)
- If trust sells for $1,250,000:
  - Gain = $1,250,000 - $1,200,000 - selling costs
  - Gain = $50,000 (not $1,050,000!)

**This saves tens or hundreds of thousands in taxes.**

### What Gets Step-Up

**Assets that receive step-up:**
- Real estate
- Stocks and bonds
- Business interests
- Collectibles and artwork
- Vehicles
- Jewelry

**Assets that DON'T receive step-up:**
- IRAs and retirement accounts
- Annuities
- Income in respect of decedent (IRD)

### California Community Property

**Special rule:** If property was community property, **BOTH** halves get step-up at first spouse's death.

**Example:**
- Husband and wife own house as community property
- Bought for $300,000, now worth $900,000
- Husband dies
- **Entire property** (both halves) gets step-up to $900,000
- Wife's basis: $900,000 (not $750,000)

**This is a huge California advantage** - not available in common law states.

## Calculating Capital Gains

### Step 1: Determine Basis

**Date-of-death value:**
- Obtain professional appraisal
- Use as of date settlor died
- This becomes your basis

**Alternate valuation date:**
- Can elect to value 6 months after death
- Only if reduces estate tax
- Rarely used

**Example basis calculation:**
Property appraised at $850,000 on date of death = Basis is $850,000

### Step 2: Calculate Gain

**Formula:**
```
Sale Price
- Adjusted Basis (date-of-death value)
- Selling Costs (commissions, fees, closing costs)
= Taxable Gain
```

**Example:**
- Sale price: $900,000
- Basis: $850,000
- Realtor commission (6%): $54,000
- Escrow/closing costs: $3,000
- **Taxable gain: $900,000 - $850,000 - $57,000 = -$7,000 (LOSS)**
- **No tax owed**

### Step 3: Apply Tax Rates

**If gain is taxable:**

| Gain Type | Federal Rate | CA Rate | Total |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Short-term | Up to 37% | Up to 13.3% | Up to 50.3% |
| Long-term | 0-20% | Up to 13.3% | Up to 33.3% |
| Plus NIIT | 3.8% | N/A | 3.8% |

**Holding period:** Inherited property is automatically long-term (even if sold immediately).

## Special Situations

### Real Estate Improvements

**After death improvements:**
- Capital improvements increase basis
- Repairs do not
- Keep receipts

**Example:**
- Basis at death: $500,000
- New roof (capital improvement): $25,000
- Paint (repair): $5,000
- **Adjusted basis: $525,000** (roof adds, paint doesn't)

### Depreciated Property

**Rental or business property:**
- Must recapture depreciation taken
- Reduces step-up benefit
- Recapture taxed at 25% (federal)

### Property Sold Below Basis

**Capital loss:**
- Can offset other capital gains
- Up to $3,000 offset against ordinary income
- Excess carries forward

**Example:**
- Basis: $300,000
- Sale price: $250,000
- **Loss: $50,000**
- Use to offset other trust gains

### Partial Interests

**If trust owns percentage:**
- Only that percentage gets step-up
- Co-owners' portions have their own basis

### Appreciated After Death

**Problem:** Property appreciates between death and sale

**Example:**
- Death date value: $800,000
- Sale price 18 months later: $950,000
- **Taxable gain: $150,000** (plus selling costs)

**Solution:** Distribute property to beneficiaries before sale if possible.

## Reporting Requirements

### Form 1099-S

**Seller receives:**
- Form 1099-S reporting gross proceeds
- Sent by escrow/title company
- IRS receives copy

**Trust must report** even if no gain.

### Form 1041 Schedule D

**Report capital gains on:**
- Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses)
- Attached to Form 1041

**Information needed:**
- Description of property
- Date acquired (date of death)
- Date sold
- Sale price
- Basis (date-of-death value)
- Selling expenses
- Gain or loss

### Form 8949

**Required before Schedule D:**
- Sales and Dispositions of Capital Assets
- Lists each transaction
- Transfers totals to Schedule D

### Distribution to Beneficiaries

**If gain distributed:**
- Reported on Schedule K-1
- Beneficiaries pay tax
- Usually better than trust paying (lower rates)

## Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Sell During Administration

**Benefit:** Property has stepped-up basis
- Minimal or no gain
- Best time to sell

**Timing:** Within 6-18 months of death typically optimal

### 2. Distribute Before Sale

**Strategy:**
- Distribute property to beneficiaries
- Beneficiaries sell
- Beneficiaries pay lower tax rates

**Example:**
- Trust faces 37% + 3.8% = 40.8% rate
- Beneficiary faces 15% rate
- Saves 25.8% on gain

**Caution:** Only works if beneficiaries cooperate.

### 3. Offset Gains with Losses

**Tax loss harvesting:**
- Sell losing investments
- Offset gains from property sale
- Losses carry forward

### 4. Time the Sale

**Market timing:**
- Don't rush if market is down
- Wait for better pricing
- Balance holding costs vs. market recovery

### 5. Installment Sale

**If selling to beneficiary or third party:**
- Spread gain over multiple years
- Report using installment method
- Defer tax

**Requirements:**
- At least one payment after tax year of sale
- Interest charged on installments

### 6. 1031 Exchange

**Like-kind exchange:**
- Defer capital gains
- Swap investment/business property
- Complex rules

**Note:** Personal residence doesn't qualify (but see §121 exclusion below).

### 7. Section 121 Exclusion

**Primary residence exclusion:**
- $250,000 per person excluded
- Must have lived in property 2 of last 5 years

**For inherited property:**
- Beneficiary can use if moves in and meets 2-year test
- Trust itself doesn't qualify
- Must distribute to beneficiary first

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using Original Purchase Price as Basis

**Mistake:** Trustee uses settlor's original cost as basis

**Example:**
- Original cost: $100,000
- Date-of-death value: $500,000
- Trustee incorrectly uses $100,000 basis
- **Overpays tax on $400,000 phantom gain**

**Solution:** Always use stepped-up basis.

### 2. No Appraisal

**Mistake:** No formal appraisal obtained

**Problem:**
- Can't prove basis
- IRS may challenge
- Lose deduction for selling costs if can't document

**Solution:** Get professional appraisal within 60-90 days of death.

### 3. Not Including Selling Costs

**Deductible selling costs:**
- Real estate commissions
- Title insurance
- Escrow fees
- Transfer taxes
- Legal fees for sale
- Recording fees

**These reduce gain dollar-for-dollar.**

### 4. Forgetting Improvements

**After-death improvements increase basis:**
- New roof
- HVAC system
- Additions
- Major renovations

**Keep receipts and add to basis.**

### 5. Distributing Property with Built-In Gain

**Problem:** Trustee distributes property that hasn't received step-up

**Example:**
- Trust bought property after death for $300,000
- Worth $400,000 at distribution
- Beneficiary's basis: $300,000 (carryover, not stepped-up)
- If sold immediately, $100,000 taxable gain

**Solution:** Sell before distribution if property was acquired after death.

## California-Specific Issues

### Proposition 19

**Limits parent-child exclusion:**
- Effective February 16, 2021
- Primary residence: $1M assessed value exclusion
- Other property: No exclusion (full reassessment)

**Property tax impact:**
- Property may be reassessed at current value
- Can trigger huge property tax increase
- Consider when deciding whether to keep or sell

### California Capital Gains Rate

**State tax up to 13.3%:**
- Added to federal rate
- No preferential long-term rate
- All gains taxed as ordinary income

**Total rates can exceed 37% (federal + state + NIIT).**

### Form 541

**Report capital gains on:**
- California Form 541 Schedule D
- Follows federal but different rates

## When to Get Professional Help

**Hire a CPA if:**
- Property value over $500,000
- Multiple properties sold
- Complicated basis calculations
- Estate tax involved (Form 706)
- Business property with depreciation
- Installment sales

**Facts:**
- House, stepped-up basis: $800,000
- Sale price: $825,000
- Realtor commission: $49,500
- Closing costs: $3,000

**Calculation:**
- Gain: $825,000 - $800,000 - $52,500 = -$27,500 **LOSS**
- **Tax owed: $0**

### Scenario 2: Appreciated Property - Tax Due

**Facts:**
- Condo, stepped-up basis: $400,000
- Sale 2 years later: $550,000
- Selling costs: $35,000

**Calculation:**
- Gain: $550,000 - $400,000 - $35,000 = $115,000
- Federal tax (20%): $23,000
- NIIT (3.8%): $4,370
- CA tax (13.3%): $15,295
- **Total tax: $42,665**

**Better strategy:** Distribute to beneficiaries before sale (might save $20,000+).

### Scenario 3: Rental Property

**Facts:**
- Rental, original cost: $250,000
- Depreciation taken by settlor: $50,000
- Adjusted basis at death: $200,000
- Stepped-up basis: $600,000
- Sale price: $650,000
- Selling costs: $40,000

**Calculation:**
- Basis: $600,000 (stepped-up)
- Gain: $650,000 - $600,000 - $40,000 = $10,000
- **No depreciation recapture** (wiped out by step-up)
- Tax on $10,000 gain only
