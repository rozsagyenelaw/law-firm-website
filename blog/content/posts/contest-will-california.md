"My father changed his will shortly before his death, disinheriting me and leaving everything to his caregiver. Can I challenge this?"

As a Glendale trust litigation attorney, I hear variations of this question regularly from people who believe a will doesn't reflect their loved one's true wishes. Contesting a will is a serious legal matter that requires valid grounds, strict adherence to deadlines, and often involves complex litigation.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain when you can contest a will in California, what constitutes valid grounds, the critical 120-day deadline, the litigation process from start to finish, costs involved, and your chances of success.

## What Is a Will Contest?

A **will contest** is a legal challenge to the validity of a will filed in probate court.

**You're arguing:** The will should not be admitted to probate because it's invalid.

**If successful:** The will is set aside, and either:
- An earlier will is admitted to probate instead, OR
- The estate passes by intestate succession (as if there were no will)

**Important distinction:** A will contest challenges whether the will is valid. This is different from:
- Disputes over will interpretation (what the will means)
- Claims against the estate (creditor claims)
- Disputes over executor's actions
- Trust litigation (separate procedures)

## Who Can Contest a Will in California?

**Not just anyone can contest a will.** California law limits who has "standing" to challenge a will.

**California Probate Code Section 48:** "Interested person" includes heirs, beneficiaries, creditors, and anyone who has a property right in or claim against the estate.

### People Who Can Contest

**1. Beneficiaries Under the Will Being Contested**
- Named in the will but received less than expected
- Named but provisions are ambiguous

**2. Beneficiaries Under a Prior Will**
- Would inherit more under earlier will
- Disinherited in new will

**3. Heirs at Law**
- Would inherit if there were no will (intestate succession)
- Includes children, spouse, parents, siblings

**4. Beneficiaries of a Trust**
- If trust would receive assets under earlier will
- If trust provisions affected by will

### People Who CANNOT Contest

**No standing:**
- Friends with no legal claim
- Distant relatives with no inheritance rights
- Caregivers (unless also beneficiaries)
- Charities (unless named in earlier will)
- People disinherited in all versions of will

**The "standing" requirement:** You must show you would benefit if the contest succeeds.

## Valid Grounds for Contesting a Will

California law recognizes specific grounds for invalidating a will. You cannot contest simply because you're unhappy with the distribution.

### Ground #1: Lack of Testamentary Capacity

**California Probate Code Section 6100.5**

**The claim:** The person who made the will lacked the mental capacity to understand what they were doing.

**Requirements for capacity:**
- Understand the nature of making a will
- Understand the nature and extent of their property
- Remember their natural beneficiaries (family)
- Understand the disposition they're making

**When capacity issues arise:**
- Advanced dementia or Alzheimer's disease
- Severe mental illness
- Delirium or confusion
- Medication effects
- Stroke or brain injury

**Important timing:** Capacity is judged at the moment the will was signed, not before or after.

**Evidence to prove lack of capacity:**
- Medical records from period around will signing
- Doctor testimony about mental state
- Statements by people who observed testator
- Prior diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment
- Irrational provisions in will
- Unusual behavior around time of signing

**Challenge:** Capacity is presumed. You must overcome this presumption with clear and convincing evidence.

### Ground #2: Undue Influence

**California Probate Code Section 86**

**The claim:** Someone exerted excessive pressure on the testator, overcoming their free will and causing them to make a will they wouldn't have made otherwise.

**Undue influence means:**
- More than just persuasion or suggestion
- Coercion, pressure, or manipulation
- Taking advantage of weakness or dependency
- Isolating testator from family
- Creating fear or obligation

**Common undue influence scenarios:**
- Caregiver receives large bequest
- New spouse disinherits children from prior marriage
- Family member isolates elderly parent
- Financial advisor receives substantial gift
- Person in position of trust benefits inappropriately

**Elements to prove undue influence:**
1. Testator was vulnerable (illness, age, dependency)
2. Influencer had opportunity to exert influence
3. Influencer had disposition to exert influence (motive)
4. Result was unnatural (disinherits family, benefits influencer)

**Presumption of undue influence (California Probate Code Section 21380):**

If gift is to person who:
- Drafted the will
- Is in fiduciary relationship with testator
- Is caregiver

**Then:** Burden shifts to them to prove gift was not product of undue influence

**Evidence of undue influence:**
- Isolation of testator from family
- Rapid changes after influencer enters life
- Testator dependent on influencer
- Influencer controlled access to testator
- Changes in estate plan benefiting influencer
- Secrecy surrounding will execution
- Testator expressed fear or reluctance
- Influencer present when will signed

### Ground #3: Fraud

**California Probate Code Section 6104**

**The claim:** Testator was deceived about material facts, causing them to make a will they wouldn't have made if they knew the truth.

**Types of fraud:**

**Fraud in the execution:**
- Testator deceived about nature of document
- Told they're signing something else (power of attorney, deed)
- Not told document is a will

**Fraud in the inducement:**
- Testator deceived about facts
- Lied to about family member's conduct
- Told false information about beneficiaries
- Misled about nature or extent of property

**Example:**
Brother tells father (falsely) that daughter has stolen from him. Father disinherits daughter based on false information. This is fraud in the inducement.

**Evidence needed:**
- Proof of false statement
- Testator believed false statement
- False statement influenced will provisions
- Intent to deceive

### Ground #4: Forgery

**The claim:** The signature on the will is not the testator's actual signature, or the will was altered after signing.

**Forms of forgery:**
- Someone else signed testator's name
- Will created after testator's death
- Provisions added or changed after execution
- Pages substituted

**Evidence:**
- Handwriting expert analysis
- Comparison to known signatures
- Testimony about signing ceremony
- Document examination (paper, ink, printing)
- Witness testimony

**Rare:** Forgery cases are less common than capacity or undue influence cases.

### Ground #5: Improper Execution

**California Probate Code Sections 6110-6113**

**The claim:** The will doesn't meet California's formal requirements for valid execution.

**California requirements for valid will:**
- In writing
- Signed by testator (or by someone at testator's direction in testator's presence)
- Signed by two witnesses who:
  - Witnessed testator's signing (or testator's acknowledgment of signature)
  - Understood document was testator's will
  - Signed as witnesses during testator's lifetime
  - Were competent at time of witnessing

**Common execution problems:**
- Only one witness (requires two)
- Witnesses didn't sign in testator's presence
- Witnesses didn't know it was a will
- Signature by someone other than testator without proper authorization

**California's substantial compliance doctrine:** Courts may uphold will with minor technical defects if clear and convincing evidence shows testator intended document to be their will.

**Holographic wills:** Different rules apply (material provisions in testator's handwriting, signed by testator—no witnesses required)

### Ground #6: Revocation

**California Probate Code Sections 6120-6124**

**The claim:** The will was revoked before testator's death.

**Methods of revocation:**
- Physical destruction (tearing, burning, canceling)
- Creation of new will
- Written revocation
- Certain life events (marriage, divorce)

**Burden:** Contestant must prove revocation occurred

### Ground #7: Duress or Menace

**The claim:** Testator was forced to make the will under threat of harm.

**Requirements:**
- Actual threat to testator or family
- Fear induced in testator
- Will created due to fear

**Rare:** Duress cases are uncommon and difficult to prove

## The Critical 120-Day Deadline

**California Probate Code Section 8200**

**Most important rule:** Will contests must be filed **within 120 days after the will is admitted to probate.**

### Understanding the Timeline

**Not 120 days from death:** The 120 days starts when the court admits the will to probate (at the first hearing).

**Typical timeline:**
- Death: January 1
- Petition filed: February 1
- First hearing: March 15 (will admitted to probate)
- Contest deadline: July 13 (120 days after March 15)

**Strict deadline:** Courts rarely extend this deadline. If you miss it, you likely lose your right to contest forever.

### Before the 120-Day Period Starts

**Good news:** You can contest before the will is admitted to probate.

**How:** File objection to Petition for Probate

**At the first hearing:** Raise your objections, and judge may:
- Deny admission of will immediately
- Order evidentiary hearing
- Admit will to probate and allow contest within 120 days

**Advantage:** Contesting early may prevent probate from starting

### What Happens If You Miss the Deadline?

**General rule:** Your contest is barred

**Very limited exceptions:**
- You didn't receive proper notice of probate proceeding
- Fraud or mistake prevented you from filing timely
- Will wasn't actually admitted to probate (procedural issue)

**These exceptions are rare and difficult to establish.**

### Strategic Consideration: When to File

**Early (before 120 days):**
- Shows seriousness
- May encourage settlement
- Preserves all options

**Near deadline:**
- More time to investigate
- Gather evidence
- Assess chances of success
- Consider settlement options

**My advice:** File earlier rather than later. You can always settle or dismiss later, but you can't undo missing the deadline.

## The Will Contest Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Consult with Attorney (Immediately)

**Critical first step:** Consult experienced probate litigation attorney

**Attorney will evaluate:**
- Whether you have standing
- Strength of your grounds
- Available evidence
- Likelihood of success
- Cost vs. potential benefit

**Timeline:** Do this immediately after learning of will provisions

**Cost:** Initial consultations often free or low-cost

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

**Before filing, collect:**

**Medical records:**
- From period around will signing
- Diagnosis of dementia, mental illness
- Medications prescribed
- Doctor notes about cognitive function

**Financial records:**
- Estate planning documents
- Prior wills
- Account statements showing unusual transactions
- Transfers to potential influencer

**Witness information:**
- People who observed testator's condition
- Family members who were isolated
- Healthcare providers
- Prior attorneys

**Documents:**
- Earlier wills and trusts
- Correspondence with testator
- Emails or texts showing influence
- Financial power of attorney documents

**Timeline:** This investigation may take several weeks

### Step 3: File Contest Petition

**Form:** Contest to Will (no specific form, usually custom-drafted petition)

**Must include:**
- Your relationship to testator
- Your standing to contest
- Specific grounds for contest
- Facts supporting each ground
- Request for relief

**Filing fee:** $435

**Where to file:** Same probate court handling estate

**Service:** Must serve on executor and all beneficiaries

### Step 4: Probate Court Hearing

**Timeline:** Hearing scheduled 4-6 weeks after filing

**What happens:**
- Judge hears initial arguments
- Determines if contest has merit
- May dismiss if clearly without merit
- Usually sets for further proceedings if contest has facial validity

**Possible outcomes:**
- Case proceeds to discovery
- Summary judgment against contestant
- Settlement discussions ordered

### Step 5: Discovery

**Process:** Both sides gather evidence through formal discovery

**Discovery methods:**
- Interrogatories (written questions)
- Requests for production of documents
- Depositions (testimony under oath)
- Subpoenas for records
- Expert witness retention

**Timeline:** 6-12 months typically

**Cost:** Discovery is expensive (see costs section below)

### Step 6: Mediation

**Often required:** Court may order mediation before trial

**Process:**
- Neutral mediator facilitates settlement discussions
- Both sides present positions
- Mediator helps find middle ground

**Benefits:**
- Saves cost of trial
- Provides certainty
- Preserves family relationships (relatively)
- Confidential

**Success rate:** Many will contests settle at mediation

### Step 7: Trial

**If no settlement:** Case proceeds to trial

**Bench trial:** Decided by judge (not jury) in California probate matters

**Length:** 2-5 days typical for will contest

**Presentation:**
- Opening statements
- Contestant's case (evidence and witnesses)
- Proponent's case (executor defends will)
- Closing arguments
- Judge's decision

**Evidence presented:**
- Expert testimony (doctors, handwriting experts)
- Lay witness testimony (family, friends, caregivers)
- Documentary evidence (medical records, financial records)
- Will execution evidence (attorney who drafted will, witnesses)

**Timeline:** 12-24 months from filing to trial

### Step 8: Judgment and Appeal

**Judge's decision:**
- Upholds will (contest fails)
- Invalidates entire will
- Invalidates specific provisions
- Admits earlier will instead

**Appeal:** Losing party can appeal (adds 1-2 years)

**Final:** After appeals exhausted, decision is final

## Costs of Contesting a Will

**Will contests are expensive.** You should understand the financial commitment before filing.

### Attorney Fees

**Hourly rates:** $350-$650/hour for experienced probate litigators

**Phases and typical costs:**

**Initial consultation and filing:** $2,500-$5,000

**Discovery phase:** $20,000-$50,000
- Interrogatories and document requests
- Depositions (multiple witnesses)
- Expert witness retention

**Mediation:** $5,000-$10,000
- Attorney preparation time
- Mediation session
- Mediator fees

**Trial:** $30,000-$75,000
- Trial preparation
- Expert witness fees
- Trial days
- Post-trial motions

**Total if going to trial:** $60,000-$150,000+

**Total if settling after discovery:** $25,000-$60,000

**Appeal (if needed):** $25,000-$50,000 additional

### Expert Witness Fees

**Medical experts:** $500-$800/hour
- Review records: $3,000-$8,000
- Deposition: $3,000-$6,000
- Trial testimony: $5,000-$10,000

**Forensic document examiners:** $5,000-$15,000 total

**Financial experts:** $10,000-$25,000 (if needed)

### Court Costs

- Filing fees: $435
- Service of process: $500-$1,000
- Court reporter fees: $2,000-$5,000
- Copying and exhibits: $500-$2,000

### Fee Arrangements

**Hourly billing:** Most common

**Contingency fees:** Rare in will contests
- Some attorneys will take on contingency (percentage of recovery)
- Usually 25-40% of what you recover
- Only if strong case with significant assets at stake

**Hybrid arrangements:** Combination of reduced hourly rate plus contingency

**Retainer:** Expect to pay $10,000-$25,000 retainer upfront

## Can You Recover Your Attorney Fees?

**General rule:** Each side pays their own attorney fees

**Exception (California Probate Code Section 11003):** Court may award fees from estate if:
- Contest was brought or defended in good faith
- Issue benefited the estate

**Reality:** Fee awards are rare and discretionary

**Don't count on fee recovery.** Plan to pay your own attorney fees.

## What Are Your Chances of Success?

**Honest assessment:** Will contests are difficult to win.

**Success rates (approximate):**
- Lack of capacity cases: 20-30% success
- Undue influence cases: 15-25% success
- Fraud cases: 25-35% success
- Forgery cases: 40-50% success (if you have proof)
- Execution defects: 30-40% success

**Why success rates are low:**
- Presumption of validity
- High burden of proof
- Testator can't testify (deceased)
- Substantial compliance doctrine
- Courts respect testamentary freedom

**Factors that improve your chances:**
- Strong medical evidence of incapacity
- Clear evidence of isolation and control
- Dramatic last-minute changes
- Beneficiary was drafter or caregiver (presumption)
- Multiple witnesses to undue influence
- Prior consistent estate plan changed suddenly

**Factors that hurt your chances:**
- Testator had capacity evaluation by attorney
- Will was explained thoroughly to testator
- Testator expressed clear reasons for changes
- Changes were made gradually over time
- Testator had history of favoring beneficiary
- No medical evidence of incapacity

## Settlement: Often the Best Outcome

**Reality:** Most will contests settle rather than going to trial.

**Typical settlement structure:**
- Contestant receives portion of estate
- Less than full inheritance but more than will provides
- Avoids cost and uncertainty of trial
- Preserves family relationships (somewhat)

**Example:**
- Will leaves everything to Brother A
- Brother B contests (would get 50% if will invalid)
- Settlement: Brother B receives 20-30% of estate
- Both sides save $50,000+ in attorney fees

**When to consider settlement:**
- Both sides have reasonable arguments
- Cost of litigation is high relative to estate value
- Family relationships matter
- Uncertainty of trial outcome
- Desire for closure

**Mediation advantage:** Neutral mediator helps parties see risks on both sides and find middle ground.

## No-Contest Clauses

**California Probate Code Section 21311**

**No-contest clause:** Will provision that disinherits anyone who contests the will

**Example:** "If any beneficiary contests this will, they shall receive nothing."

**Effect:** Creates risk that if you lose contest, you get nothing (not even what will left you)

**California law:** No-contest clauses are enforceable ONLY if contest was brought without probable cause

**"Probable cause" means:** You had reasonable basis for contest based on known facts at time of filing

**Effect:** No-contest clauses are less scary than they used to be. If you have good grounds, clause won't punish you for losing.

**Strategic consideration:** Evaluate whether contest has probable cause before filing

## Special Situations

### Contesting a Trust Instead of a Will

**Different procedures:** Trust contests follow different rules

**Timeline:** Usually 120 days after receiving notice of trust after trustor's death

**Grounds:** Similar (capacity, undue influence, fraud)

**Process:** Often more complex than will contests

### Multiple Wills

**Situation:** Multiple wills found, potentially conflicting

**Process:** Court determines which will is valid and latest

**Contest strategy:** May argue earlier will is valid, later will is not

### Partial Contest

**Possibility:** Contest specific provisions rather than entire will

**Example:** "I contest the bequest to the caregiver, but not the rest of the will"

**Strategic benefit:** Reduces risk, focuses on most problematic provisions

## Should You Contest a Will?

**Consider these factors:**

**Strong grounds exist:**
- Clear medical evidence of incapacity
- Evidence of isolation and control
- Dramatic last-minute changes
- Beneficiary was drafter or caregiver

**Significant assets at stake:**
- Estate value justifies litigation costs
- Your potential inheritance is substantial
- Cost-benefit analysis favorable

**Evidence is available:**
- Medical records accessible
- Witnesses willing to testify
- Documentary evidence exists

**You can afford litigation:**
- Have funds for attorney fees
- Can sustain multi-year process
- Emotional fortitude for litigation

**When NOT to contest:**
- Weak grounds (just unhappy with distribution)
- Small estate (costs exceed potential recovery)
- Little evidence available
- No-contest clause and risky case
- Testator clearly wanted distribution
- Settlement negotiations refused
