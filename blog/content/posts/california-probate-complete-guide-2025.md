<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;"><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> In 2025, California probate administration typically costs 4–7% of the gross estate value ($26,000–$46,000 for a $500,000 estate) and takes 12–18 months due to backlogs in the Los Angeles Superior Court. While a <a href="/" style="color: #1a4b8c;">Glendale living trust</a> avoids this entirely, if you are currently facing a court case, understanding the <strong>Independent Administration of Estates Act (IAEA)</strong> and the role of the <strong>Probate Referee</strong> is critical.</p>

# California Probate Administration 2025: A Guide to the Stanley Mosk & Pasadena Courts

## Navigating the Los Angeles Probate Backlog

If you have recently lost a loved one in Glendale, Burbank, or Pasadena, you are likely dealing with the **Stanley Mosk Courthouse** or the **Pasadena Probate Department**. As a [probate attorney in Glendale](/probate-attorney-glendale) with over 25 years of experience, I've seen how the 2025 court delays can freeze a family's assets.

Whether you are seeking **Letters of Administration** because there was no will, or you are an Executor named in a testament, this guide explains how to protect the estate's value from statutory fees and court delays.

## How Much Does Probate Cost in California? (2025 Statutory Fees)

California is unique because attorney and executor fees are set by **California Probate Code §10800**. These fees are calculated on the *gross value* of the estate, meaning mortgages and debts are not subtracted before the percentage is applied.

### The Statutory Fee Schedule

The attorney and the executor are *each* entitled to:

- **4%** of the first $100,000
- **3%** of the next $100,000
- **2%** of the next $800,000
- **1%** of the next $9,000,000

For a standard **$1,000,000 Glendale home**, the combined statutory fees for the attorney and executor total **$46,000**.

## The 7-Step Probate Administration Roadmap

To settle an estate in Los Angeles County, you must follow a strict procedural timeline. Missing a single filing can add six months to your case.

1. **Filing the Petition (DE-111):** Lodging the will and requesting the appointment of a Personal Representative.
2. **Notice of Petition:** Publishing notice in the *Glendale Independent* or *Burbank Leader* to alert creditors.
3. **Issuance of Letters:** Obtaining **Letters Testamentary** from the judge to gain access to bank accounts.
4. **Inventory & Appraisal:** Submitting assets to a court-appointed **Probate Referee** to determine fair market value.
5. **Creditor Claims Period:** A mandatory 4-month window for debts to be filed.
6. **Final Accounting:** A detailed report of every dollar spent and earned by the estate.
7. **Order of Distribution:** The judge signs the order to transfer titles to the heirs.

## The "Big Money" Shortcut: The IAEA

The most important term an Executor should know in 2025 is the **Independent Administration of Estates Act (IAEA)**. When we petition for "Full Authority" under the IAEA, we can often sell real estate in Magnolia Park or the Rancho District without waiting for a court confirmation hearing. This allows you to close escrow in 30 days rather than 6 months.

Learn more about [executor authority to sell property](/probate) and how the IAEA can expedite your case.

## New 2025 Probate Limits (AB 2016)

As of April 1, 2025, California has updated the thresholds for simplified procedures:

- **Small Estate Affidavit:** Now **$208,850** for personal property.
- **Primary Residence Limit:** Under AB 2016, primary residences valued up to **$750,000** may qualify for a simplified transfer, though most homes in the San Fernando Valley still exceed this limit and require full probate.

## How to Avoid Probate: The $575 Solution

While probate is a vital service, it is a "voluntary" tax. By establishing an [affordable $575 living trust package](/), you ensure your family skips the Stanley Mosk Courthouse entirely.
