Being named executor of someone's estate is both an honor and a significant responsibility. As a Glendale probate attorney who has guided hundreds of executors through California probate, I understand how overwhelming the role can feel, especially when you're grieving the loss of someone you cared about.

The good news? California Probate Code provides clear guidelines for executor duties, and with proper guidance, you can fulfill your responsibilities efficiently and avoid personal liability.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through every executor duty from the moment of death through final distribution, provide detailed checklists, explain your legal responsibilities, and clarify your rights to compensation.

## What Is an Executor?

An executor (also called "personal representative" in California) is the person named in a will to manage the deceased person's estate through the probate process.

### Executor vs. Administrator

**Executor:** Named in the will
**Administrator:** Appointed by the court when there is no will or the named executor cannot serve

The duties are identical—only the title differs.

### When Do Executor Powers Begin?

**Important:** Your authority as executor does not begin automatically when someone dies, even if you're named in their will.

**You must:**
1. File a Petition for Probate with the court
2. Attend a court hearing
3. Be formally appointed by the judge
4. Take an oath of office
5. Receive Letters Testamentary from the court

**Only after receiving Letters Testamentary do you have legal authority to act on behalf of the estate.**

## Complete Executor Duties Checklist

Let me break down your responsibilities into phases, with detailed action items for each stage.

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions After Death (First 2 Weeks)

### 1. Secure the Deceased's Property

**Your responsibility:** Protect estate assets from loss, theft, or damage.

**Action items:**
- Change locks on the deceased's residence if necessary
- Secure valuable personal property (jewelry, art, collectibles)
- Ensure adequate insurance coverage on real property
- Take possession of important documents (will, deeds, financial records)
- Protect business interests if applicable
- Secure vehicles and change registration if needed

**Legal standard:** California Probate Code Section 8400 requires executors to use "reasonable care and diligence" in managing estate property.

**Liability warning:** You can be held personally liable for losses caused by negligence in securing estate property.

### 2. Locate the Original Will

**Your responsibility:** Find and safeguard the original will.

**Where to look:**
- Deceased's home (safe, filing cabinet, desk)
- Attorney's office
- Bank safe deposit box (you'll need court order for access)
- With other important papers

**Important:** California requires the original will with original signatures. Photocopies are not acceptable unless the original is proven lost and specific procedures are followed.

### 3. Order Death Certificates

**Your responsibility:** Obtain official death certificates.

**How many to order:** 10-15 certified copies
**Where to order:** County health department or funeral home

### 4. Identify and Notify Immediate Beneficiaries

### 5. Arrange for Immediate Expenses

**Your responsibility:** Ensure ongoing expenses are paid.

**Priority payments (before probate opens):**

- Mortgage payments (to prevent foreclosure)
- Property insurance
- Utilities (if property is unoccupied)

**Why you need an attorney:**

## Executor Compensation in California

As executor, you're entitled to compensation for your work.

### Statutory Executor Fees

California Probate Code Section 10800 sets statutory fees based on estate value:

| Estate Value | Executor Fee |
|--------------|--------------|
| First $100,000 | 4% ($4,000) |
| Next $100,000 | 3% ($3,000) |
| Next $800,000 | 2% |
| Next $9,000,000 | 1% |
| Next $15,000,000 | 0.5% |

**Example for $1M estate:** $23,000

### Important Tax Consideration

**Executor fees are taxable income** to you personally (subject to income tax).

**Inheritances are tax-free** to beneficiaries.

**If you're also a beneficiary:** Consider waiving executor fees because:
- Fees are taxable to you
- Fee amount reduces estate value
- Reduces your inheritance as well
- Usually not worth the tax hit unless you're a minor beneficiary

### Extraordinary Compensation

You can petition for extra compensation beyond statutory fees for:
- Extraordinary services
- Unusual complications
- Litigation
- Business operations

**Must prove:** Services were outside normal executor duties and provided benefit to estate.

## Executor's Fiduciary Duties

As executor, you owe fiduciary duties to beneficiaries—the highest duty recognized by law.

### Duty of Loyalty

**Requirement:** Act solely in the best interests of beneficiaries, not yourself.

**Prohibited actions:**
- Self-dealing (buying estate assets yourself)
- Conflicts of interest
- Favoring one beneficiary over others
- Using position for personal gain

### Duty of Impartiality

**Requirement:** Treat all beneficiaries fairly and equally.

**Must:**
- Not favor one beneficiary over another
- Distribute according to will terms
- Give equal access to information

### Duty of Care

**Requirement:** Use reasonable care and skill in managing estate.

**Standard:** How a prudent person would manage their own property.

### Duty to Keep Beneficiaries Informed

**Requirement:** Provide information about estate administration.

**Best practices:**
- Send quarterly status updates
- Respond promptly to questions
- Provide copies of accountings
- Explain delays or complications

### Duty Not to Commingle

**Requirement:** Keep estate property completely separate from personal property.

**Must:**
- Use estate bank account only for estate funds
- Never mix estate and personal money
- Never "borrow" from estate (even temporarily)

**Violation consequences:** Personal liability, removal as executor, potential criminal charges.

### Duty to Account

**Requirement:** Keep accurate records of all transactions.

**Must:**
- Document every receipt
- Document every disbursement
- Maintain receipts and invoices
- Provide accounting to beneficiaries

## Executor Liability and Protection

### When Can You Be Held Personally Liable?

**Breach of fiduciary duty:**
- Self-dealing
- Negligence
- Fraud
- Commingling funds

**Improper distributions:**
- Distributing before paying all debts

**Tax issues:**
- Failing to file required tax returns
- Failing to pay estate taxes

**Negligence:**
- Allowing property to deteriorate
- Making poor investment decisions

### How to Protect Yourself

**1. Hire experienced attorney:** Don't try to handle probate alone.

**2. Get court approval:** For questionable actions, file petition seeking court approval. Court approval protects you from liability.

**3. Document everything:** Keep detailed records of all decisions and actions.

**4. Communicate with beneficiaries:** Keep them informed and get their input on major decisions.

**5. Get insurance:** Consider executor's bond or fiduciary liability insurance.

**6. Don't rush:** Take time to do things correctly rather than quickly.

**7. Request receipts:** Get signed receipts from every beneficiary for distributions.

**8. Treat estate money as if it's not yours:** Because it isn't.

## When to Decline Appointment as Executor

Being executor is not mandatory. You can decline if:
- You don't have time for the extensive responsibilities
- You live far away from the estate property
- There are family conflicts that make the role impossible
- Your own health issues prevent you from serving
- You have conflicts of interest
- You don't feel capable of handling the duties

**How to decline:**
- File declination with court before appointment
- Court will appoint successor named in will
- If no successor, court appoints administrator

**No shame in declining:** Better to decline than to serve poorly.
