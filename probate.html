Key duties include filing the will with the probate court, obtaining letters testamentary, inventorying and appraising estate assets, paying debts and taxes, managing estate property, distributing assets to beneficiaries, and providing a final accounting to the court. The executor must act in the best interests of the estate and beneficiaries, following California Probate Code requirements."

Letters testamentary give the executor legal authority to act on behalf of the estate, access accounts, sell property, and manage estate affairs.

The minimum timeline is about 6 months due to the creditor claim period (4 months from notice publication). Key timeframes: Petition filing (within 30 days of death recommended), court hearing (30-60 days after filing), creditor claims period (4 months after notice published), inventory due (4 months after letters issued), and final distribution (after all debts paid and creditor period expired). Delays can occur due to will contests, estate tax issues, real estate sales, or beneficiary disputes. Executors should work diligently to avoid unnecessary delays that could result in removal."

Any interested party (beneficiary, heir, creditor) can petition the court for removal under California Probate Code Section 8500-8502. The court will hold a hearing and may remove the executor if there is good cause. A successor executor or administrator will then be appointed to complete the probate process."

Common reasons for delays include unresolved creditor claims, pending litigation, tax issues, or real estate sales. However, unreasonable delays or refusal to distribute without valid cause is grounds for removal. Executors must act in good faith and cannot unreasonably delay distributions."

With IAEA authority (full or limited), executors can sell real estate, distribute assets, pay claims, and make other decisions without a court hearing. Full IAEA authority requires all beneficiaries to consent or be properly noticed. Limited IAEA excludes certain powers. IAEA authority is requested when filing the Petition for Probate (Form DE-140). This is the preferred method for most estates as it reduces delays, court appearances, and legal costs while maintaining accountability through required notices and accountings."

The court appoints an administrator (not executor) to manage the estate. Distribution depends on surviving relatives: spouse inherits community property and may inherit all or part of separate property depending on other survivors; if no spouse, children inherit equally; if no children, parents inherit; then siblings, then nieces/nephews, then grandparents, and so on. Without any relatives, assets go to the state. The probate process is the same, but following intestacy laws instead of a will. An administrator must be appointed by filing a Petition for Letters of Administration."

To use it, complete form DE-305, wait the required time, present the affidavit to the holder of the asset (bank, DMV, etc.) with a death certificate.

Can be used for all types of assets including real estate, bank accounts, vehicles, and personal property. Requirements: 1) Petitioner must be surviving spouse, 2) At least 40 days since death, 3) Assets pass to spouse under will or by operation of law, 4) No one else has been appointed representative.

If you have legal standing and grounds to contest, it's critical to act quickly. The 120-day period begins when the court admits the will and appoints the executor. After this deadline, you generally lose the right to contest except in rare circumstances (like later-discovered fraud or forgery). If you believe a will is invalid, consult a probate litigation attorney immediately. Delays can be fatal to your case. The court may allow contests after the deadline only in exceptional situations."

                    When a loved one dies, those left behind are often left to not only cope with the loss of a loved one,
                    but also to administer their loved one's estate. If the estate's assets are not held by a trust,
                    the assets may need to be administered through the "Probate" process.

                        When my father passed suddenly, I discovered he owned property in three counties and had debts I knew nothing about.
                        Rozsa Law Firm took over everything - they found assets we didn't even know existed. I never paid a penny upfront.
                        They saved us at least $15,000 in taxes alone.

                        My siblings and I were fighting over mom's estate and headed for court. Rozsa Law Firm stepped in and resolved everything peacefully.
                        They advanced all the costs, sold the house for more than we expected, and made sure everyone got their fair share.
