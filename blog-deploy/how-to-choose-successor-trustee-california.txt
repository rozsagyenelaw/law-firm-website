7:T79e3,<p>Choosing your successor trustee is one of the most important decisions you'll make when creating your California living trust—yet most people spend less time on this choice than they do picking a restaurant for dinner.</p>
<p>Your successor trustee will control your financial life if you become incapacitated, and they'll manage and distribute your entire estate after you die. They'll have access to your bank accounts, your home, your investments—everything. They'll make decisions affecting your family's inheritance. They'll interpret your wishes when situations arise you didn't anticipate.</p>
<p>Choose the right person, and your trust administration will be smooth, efficient, and exactly what you intended. Choose the wrong person, and you've set the stage for family conflict, financial mismanagement, litigation, and outcomes that contradict everything you worked to accomplish.</p>
<p>As a Glendale trust attorney who has represented both trustees and beneficiaries in hundreds of trust administrations and litigation cases, I've seen excellent trustees save families tens of thousands of dollars and enormous stress. I've also seen disastrous trustee choices tear families apart and destroy inheritances.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain exactly what a successor trustee does, the 12 critical factors to consider when choosing yours, red flags to watch for, alternatives if you don't have a good individual choice, and how to set up your trustee succession plan to protect your family.</p>
<h2>What Does a Successor Trustee Actually Do?</h2>
<p>Before you can choose the right successor trustee, you need to understand what they'll actually do. Many people choose based on emotion ("my oldest child") or tradition ("my spouse, then my children equally") without considering the actual responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Duties If You Become Incapacitated</h3>
<p>If you're still alive but unable to manage your affairs, your successor trustee steps in to:</p>
<p><strong>Financial Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pay your bills from trust accounts</li>
<li>Manage trust investments</li>
<li>File your tax returns</li>
<li>Handle trust property (maintain home, collect rent, etc.)</li>
<li>Make financial decisions in your best interest</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Record Keeping:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain detailed records of all trust transactions</li>
<li>Account for trust income and expenses</li>
<li>Prepare accountings for remainder beneficiaries if required</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Act in your best interest (fiduciary duty)</li>
<li>Manage assets prudently</li>
<li>Keep trust assets separate from personal assets</li>
<li>Avoid conflicts of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>This can last months, years, or even decades if you have a long-term incapacity.</p>
<h3>Duties After Your Death</h3>
<p>After you die, your successor trustee becomes responsible for:</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Tasks (First Few Weeks):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secure trust property</li>
<li>Notify beneficiaries</li>
<li>Obtain death certificate</li>
<li>Change locks on real estate if necessary</li>
<li>Ensure adequate insurance on property</li>
<li>File notice of death with Social Security</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Asset Management (Months 1-3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory all trust assets</li>
<li>Obtain appraisals for real estate and valuable personal property</li>
<li>Open trust estate bank account</li>
<li>Collect life insurance proceeds</li>
<li>Transfer retirement accounts to inherited IRAs</li>
<li>Review and consolidate investments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Debts and Expenses (Months 2-6):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notify known creditors</li>
<li>Review and pay valid debts</li>
<li>Pay final income taxes</li>
<li>Pay property taxes</li>
<li>Pay utilities and ongoing expenses</li>
<li>Reject invalid or suspicious claims</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tax Obligations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>File final individual income tax return (Form 1040)</li>
<li>File trust income tax returns if required (Form 1041)</li>
<li>File estate tax return if estate exceeds exemption (Form 706)</li>
<li>Obtain tax ID number for trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distributions (Months 4-8):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interpret trust terms</li>
<li>Value assets for distribution</li>
<li>Decide whether to distribute in cash or in-kind</li>
<li>Handle disputes among beneficiaries</li>
<li>Make required distributions per trust terms</li>
<li>Prepare final accounting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing Trust (Months 6-12):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain receipts from all beneficiaries</li>
<li>Prepare final accounting</li>
<li>Distribute remaining assets</li>
<li>Close trust bank accounts</li>
<li>File final tax returns</li>
</ul>
<h3>California Law Requirements</h3>
<p>Under California Probate Code Section 16000 and following, trustees must:</p>
<p><strong>Duty of Loyalty (Section 16002):</strong>
Administer trust solely in beneficiaries' interest</p>
<p><strong>Duty of Impartiality (Section 16003):</strong>
Treat all beneficiaries fairly</p>
<p><strong>Duty of Prudence (Section 16040):</strong>
Exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution</p>
<p><strong>Duty to Inform (Section 16060):</strong>
Keep beneficiaries reasonably informed</p>
<p><strong>Duty to Account (Section 16062):</strong>
Provide accountings to beneficiaries</p>
<p><strong>Liability:</strong>
Trustees are personally liable for breaches of trust. They can be sued, removed, and required to pay damages plus attorney fees.</p>
<p>This isn't a ceremonial position. It's a serious legal responsibility.</p>
<h2>12 Critical Factors for Choosing Your Successor Trustee</h2>
<p>Now let's examine exactly what to consider when selecting your successor trustee.</p>
<h3>1. Trustworthiness and Integrity</h3>
<p>This is #1 for a reason. Your trustee will have complete access to all trust assets. They could steal, mismanage, or favor themselves over other beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Would I trust this person with my life savings?</li>
<li>Do they have a history of honest, ethical behavior?</li>
<li>Have they ever been involved in financial misconduct?</li>
<li>Do they have judgments, liens, or bankruptcy in their background?</li>
<li>Would they resist temptation to "borrow" from the trust?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Red Flags:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>History of dishonesty in any context</li>
<li>Financial desperation</li>
<li>Substance abuse issues</li>
<li>Gambling problems</li>
<li>Previous mismanagement of others' money</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong>
I represented beneficiaries whose father named their brother as trustee. The brother had always been the "favorite son." Within six months of their father's death, he had transferred $300,000 from trust accounts to his personal accounts, claiming it was "compensation" for his time. Two years of litigation followed.</p>
<h3>2. Financial Competence and Experience</h3>
<p>Your trustee doesn't need to be a financial expert, but they should have basic financial literacy and good judgment with money.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manages their own finances responsibly</li>
<li>Understands investments, real estate, taxes</li>
<li>Pays their own bills on time</li>
<li>Makes prudent financial decisions</li>
<li>Comfortable working with financial advisors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warning Signs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple bankruptcies</li>
<li>Chronic money problems</li>
<li>Doesn't understand basic financial concepts</li>
<li>History of poor financial decisions</li>
<li>Unable to balance own checkbook</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong>
Does this person need to be a financial genius? No. But they should be capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding bank statements</li>
<li>Working with accountants and financial advisors</li>
<li>Making prudent decisions about selling property or investments</li>
<li>Recognizing when they need professional help</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Organizational Skills and Attention to Detail</h3>
<p>Trust administration involves extensive paperwork, deadlines, and record-keeping.</p>
<p><strong>Required Skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining organized records</li>
<li>Meeting tax filing deadlines</li>
<li>Tracking income and expenses</li>
<li>Preparing accountings</li>
<li>Managing multiple beneficiary distributions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is this person generally organized in their own life?</li>
<li>Do they follow through on commitments?</li>
<li>Are they detail-oriented or do things "slip through the cracks"?</li>
<li>Can they handle complex multi-step processes?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-World Issue:</strong>
I worked with a family whose mother chose her most loving, caring daughter as trustee. Unfortunately, this daughter was chronically disorganized. She missed tax filing deadlines (creating penalties), lost important documents, and couldn't produce adequate records for the accounting. What should have been a 6-month administration took 2.5 years.</p>
<h3>4. Availability and Time Commitment</h3>
<p>Serving as trustee, especially in the first year, is time-consuming.</p>
<p><strong>Time Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial months: 10-20 hours per week</li>
<li>Ongoing administration: 5-10 hours per month</li>
<li>Complex estates: Much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does this person have time to commit to this responsibility?</li>
<li>Are they in a demanding career phase?</li>
<li>Do they have young children requiring attention?</li>
<li>Are they in good health?</li>
<li>Will they be available when needed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warning Signs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Travels extensively for work</li>
<li>Already overwhelmed with current responsibilities</li>
<li>Health issues limiting availability</li>
<li>Nearing retirement age (may not outlive you)</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Geographic Location</h3>
<p>California trust administration is much easier when your trustee lives locally.</p>
<p><strong>Why Location Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Need to access and secure California real property</li>
<li>Court appearances if disputes arise (in California)</li>
<li>Meeting with California accountants, attorneys, appraisers</li>
<li>Physically managing property sales, estate sales, etc.</li>
<li>Distributing personal property items</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-State Trustee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can easily access trust property</li>
<li>Familiar with California laws</li>
<li>No travel costs for trust administration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Out-of-State Trustee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May work fine for simple estates (bank accounts, investments)</li>
<li>Problematic for California real estate</li>
<li>Creates expenses for travel to California</li>
<li>May not be familiar with California trust law</li>
<li>Consider naming California co-trustee or California-based professional trustee</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California Law:</strong>
California doesn't require trustees to be California residents, but practical administration is much easier with local trustees.</p>
<h3>6. Relationship with Beneficiaries</h3>
<p>Your trustee will interact extensively with your beneficiaries. Consider existing family dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trusted and respected by all beneficiaries</li>
<li>History of fair dealing</li>
<li>Good communicator</li>
<li>Neutral in family disputes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Red Flags:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Existing conflicts with beneficiaries</li>
<li>History of family disputes involving this person</li>
<li>Beneficiaries don't respect or trust this person</li>
<li>This person has shown favoritism among family members</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Dilemma:</strong>
Many people name one child as trustee with all children as equal beneficiaries. This works well when:</p>
<ul>
<li>All siblings get along</li>
<li>The trustee child is respected by others</li>
<li>The trustee child is fair and communicative</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates problems when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sibling rivalry exists</li>
<li>Other children resent the "favorite" being in control</li>
<li>The trustee child has different values about money or property</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Age and Health</h3>
<p>Your trustee should likely outlive you and be healthy enough to serve.</p>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Current age and life expectancy</li>
<li>Health status</li>
<li>Whether they're likely to be alive and capable when needed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Issues:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Naming Spouse:</strong>
If you're both similar ages, your spouse may not survive you or may be incapacitated themselves when you die.</p>
<p><strong>Naming Elderly Parents:</strong>
Unlikely to outlive you; may themselves become incapacitated.</p>
<p><strong>Naming Someone Much Younger:</strong>
May lack maturity or financial experience now, but will likely be capable when actually needed.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong>
Name multiple successor trustees in order (first choice, second choice, third choice) to account for death or incapacity.</p>
<h3>8. Potential Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>Be alert to situations where your trustee's personal interests might conflict with beneficiaries' interests.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Conflicts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trustee Is Also a Beneficiary:</strong>
This is extremely common and usually okay, but creates potential conflicts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deciding whether to sell family home</li>
<li>Setting their own trustee compensation</li>
<li>Deciding timing of distributions (distribute now vs. keep invested)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trustee Stands to Benefit from Delay:</strong>
If trustee compensation is ongoing, they might prolong administration.</p>
<p><strong>Trustee Has Business Relationship with Estate:</strong>
Example: Your business partner managing trust that includes business interests.</p>
<p><strong>Trustee's Spouse Has Interest:</strong>
Example: Child's spouse influences trustee decisions.</p>
<p><strong>How to Address:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Require accountings to all beneficiaries</li>
<li>Limit trustee compensation to California statutory rates</li>
<li>Name co-trustees to provide checks and balances</li>
<li>Include trust provisions addressing specific conflicts</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Willingness to Serve</h3>
<p>This seems obvious, but many people name trustees without asking them.</p>
<p><strong>Important Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask first</strong> - Don't surprise someone by naming them</li>
<li><strong>Explain responsibilities</strong> - Make sure they understand what's involved</li>
<li><strong>Get commitment</strong> - Ensure they're actually willing</li>
<li><strong>Discuss compensation</strong> - Clarify they can receive reasonable compensation</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong>
An unwilling trustee may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decline to serve, creating delays while court appoints someone</li>
<li>Do a poor job because they resent the burden</li>
<li>Resign midway through administration</li>
<li>Make mistakes due to lack of engagement</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Judgment and Decision-Making Ability</h3>
<p>Trust administration requires countless judgment calls about issues you couldn't anticipate.</p>
<p><strong>Judgment Needed For:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether to sell assets or distribute in-kind</li>
<li>How to handle beneficiary requests for early distributions</li>
<li>Whether to contest creditor claims</li>
<li>How to divide personal property fairly</li>
<li>When to hire professionals vs. handle matters themselves</li>
<li>How to interpret ambiguous trust provisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does this person make good decisions in their own life?</li>
<li>Are they impulsive or thoughtful?</li>
<li>Do they seek advice when needed?</li>
<li>Can they handle pressure and conflict?</li>
<li>Are they decisive or do they agonize over decisions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>11. Communication Skills</h3>
<p>Your trustee must communicate with beneficiaries, professionals, creditors, and others.</p>
<p><strong>Required Communication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining trust terms to beneficiaries</li>
<li>Responding to beneficiary questions and concerns</li>
<li>Managing beneficiary expectations</li>
<li>Working with attorneys, accountants, financial advisors</li>
<li>Negotiating with creditors</li>
<li>Handling disputes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideal Trustee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Communicates clearly and promptly</li>
<li>Provides regular updates</li>
<li>Returns calls and emails</li>
<li>Explains decisions and reasoning</li>
<li>Listens to concerns</li>
<li>Documents communications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Poor Trustee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fails to respond to beneficiary inquiries</li>
<li>Provides no updates on administration progress</li>
<li>Makes decisions without explanation</li>
<li>Becomes defensive about questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Many trust disputes arise not from actual wrongdoing, but from poor communication creating suspicion.</p>
<h3>12. Understanding of Your Values and Wishes</h3>
<p>Your trustee will interpret your trust terms and make decisions you didn't specifically address.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong>
Your trust can't anticipate every situation. Your trustee will face questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mom's trust says "divide personal property equally"—how do we value sentimental items?</li>
<li>Trust says distribute at age 25, but beneficiary has addiction issues—should we delay?</li>
<li>Should we sell the family home or let one child buy it?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideal:</strong>
Someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knows you well</li>
<li>Understands your values</li>
<li>Respects your wishes</li>
<li>Would make decisions you'd approve of</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong>
Would this person honor your intent even when:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's inconvenient?</li>
<li>It conflicts with their personal interest?</li>
<li>Beneficiaries pressure them differently?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Trustee Selection Scenarios</h2>
<p>Let me walk through typical situations and considerations:</p>
<h3>Scenario 1: Naming Your Spouse</h3>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Knows your wishes intimately</li>
<li>Trusted completely</li>
<li>Familiar with family assets</li>
<li>Will prioritize family's interests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May be similar age (might predecease you)</li>
<li>May become incapacitated themselves</li>
<li>May not have financial management experience</li>
<li>Might be grieving and overwhelmed when they need to serve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong>
Name spouse as first successor trustee, but ensure you have strong second and third choices for when spouse can't serve.</p>
<h3>Scenario 2: Naming One Child as Trustee with All Children as Beneficiaries</h3>
<p>This is extremely common. It works well when:</p>
<p><strong>Good Choice When:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One child has clearly better financial/organizational skills</li>
<li>All children agree this child is the right choice</li>
<li>The chosen child is fair and communicates well</li>
<li>No significant sibling rivalry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problems When:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Other children resent the "chosen" child</li>
<li>Chosen child favors themselves</li>
<li>Chosen child makes decisions others disagree with</li>
<li>Creates or exacerbates sibling conflict</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Name all children as co-trustees</li>
<li>Name independent professional trustee</li>
<li>Rotate trustee role</li>
<li>Name eldest child first, with younger children as successors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario 3: Naming Multiple Co-Trustees</h3>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Checks and balances</li>
<li>Shared burden</li>
<li>Different skills complement each other</li>
<li>Demonstrates fairness (all children equal)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires agreement on all decisions</li>
<li>Slows down administration</li>
<li>What if co-trustees disagree?</li>
<li>What if one becomes unavailable?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit to 2-3 co-trustees maximum</li>
<li>Specify whether unanimous or majority decisions control</li>
<li>Define how disagreements are resolved</li>
<li>Ensure co-trustees have compatible personalities</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario 4: Naming a Professional Trustee</h3>
<p><strong>When to Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No family member is suitable</li>
<li>Family conflict makes neutral party necessary</li>
<li>Very complex estate</li>
<li>Long-term trust management needed</li>
<li>Want expert management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bank trust department</li>
<li>Trust company</li>
<li>Professional fiduciary</li>
<li>Attorney specializing in trust administration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expert management</li>
<li>No family conflicts</li>
<li>Accountable to strict legal standards</li>
<li>Bonded and insured</li>
<li>Won't die or become incapacitated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive (typically 1-2% of assets annually)</li>
<li>Doesn't know family personally</li>
<li>May be impersonal</li>
<li>Makes decisions by policy, not personal knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hybrid Approach:</strong>
Name family member and professional as co-trustees—family member provides personal knowledge, professional provides expertise.</p>
<h3>Scenario 5: Blended Families</h3>
<p><strong>Unique Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Potential conflicts between current spouse and children from prior marriage</li>
<li>Distrust about fairness</li>
<li>Different priorities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name Neutral Party:</strong>
Professional trustee or trusted friend (not family from either side).</p>
<p><strong>Name Co-Trustees:</strong>
Your spouse and one of your children, requiring agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Separate Trusts:</strong>
Create separate trusts for spouse's share and children's shares with different trustees.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Instructions:</strong>
Very specific trust terms minimize trustee discretion and potential for conflict.</p>
<h2>Red Flags: Who NOT to Choose as Trustee</h2>
<p>Certain characteristics make someone a poor trustee choice:</p>
<h3>Financial Red Flags</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bankruptcy history</li>
<li>Judgments or liens against them</li>
<li>Chronic money problems</li>
<li>Lives beyond their means</li>
<li>Has asked you for loans</li>
</ul>
<h3>Personal Red Flags</h3>
<ul>
<li>Substance abuse issues</li>
<li>Mental health issues affecting judgment</li>
<li>History of dishonesty</li>
<li>Extreme financial desperation</li>
<li>Involved in prior trust or estate disputes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relationship Red Flags</h3>
<ul>
<li>Estranged from family</li>
<li>Controlling or manipulative</li>
<li>Plays favorites among family</li>
<li>Poor communication skills</li>
<li>History of family conflict</li>
</ul>
<h3>Practical Red Flags</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lives very far away (international)</li>
<li>Seriously ill</li>
<li>Very elderly</li>
<li>Extremely busy/unavailable</li>
<li>Unwilling to serve</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting Up Your Trustee Succession Plan</h2>
<p>Don't just name one successor trustee—create a comprehensive succession plan.</p>
<h3>Recommended Structure:</h3>
<p><strong>Current Trustee:</strong>
You (and spouse if joint trust)</p>
<p><strong>First Successor Trustee:</strong>
Your first choice (often spouse, adult child, or sibling)</p>
<p><strong>Second Successor Trustee:</strong>
Backup in case first choice can't serve</p>
<p><strong>Third Successor Trustee:</strong>
Additional backup</p>
<p><strong>Default Provision:</strong>
If no named successor is willing/able, specify how replacement will be chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Majority vote of beneficiaries</li>
<li>Court appointment</li>
<li>Professional trustee</li>
<li>Specific trust company</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trust Provisions to Include:</h3>
<p><strong>Compensation:</strong>
Specify trustee compensation (California statutory rates or different amount).</p>
<p><strong>Removal:</strong>
Can beneficiaries remove trustee? Under what circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>Resignation:</strong>
Process for trustee to resign.</p>
<p><strong>Successor Selection:</strong>
How is replacement trustee chosen if named successors can't serve?</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong>
Exactly what powers does trustee have? (sell property, make investments, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Bond:</strong>
Required or waived?</p>
<p><strong>Accountings:</strong>
How often must trustee provide accountings to beneficiaries?</p>
<p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong>
Mediation required before litigation?</p>
<h2>Can You Change Your Trustee Choice?</h2>
<p>Yes! Your revocable living trust can be amended at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Change:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original choice died or became incapacitated</li>
<li>Relationship deteriorated</li>
<li>Original choice moved away</li>
<li>Original choice is no longer suitable</li>
<li>Family circumstances changed</li>
<li>Better option now available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Change:</strong>
Execute trust amendment changing trustee provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Review Regularly:</strong>
Review trustee nominations every 3-5 years to ensure choices remain appropriate.</p>
<h2>Special Considerations for California Trustees</h2>
<h3>California-Specific Issues:</h3>
<p><strong>Real Property:</strong>
California real estate requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding of California title and deed processes</li>
<li>Knowledge of California property taxes and Proposition 13</li>
<li>Ability to access property physically if needed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community Property:</strong>
California's community property laws create complexities trustees must navigate.</p>
<p><strong>Probate Code Requirements:</strong>
California has specific trustee notification and accounting requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Licensing:</strong>
Some professional trustees must be licensed in California (California Probate Code Section 16014.5).</p>
<h2>Take Action: Review Your Trustee Choice</h2>
<p>If you already have a trust, ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would my named successor trustee still be my choice today?</li>
<li>Is my successor trustee still alive and capable?</li>
<li>Have circumstances changed affecting their suitability?</li>
<li>Do I have adequate backup successors?</li>
<li>Have I actually asked them if they're willing to serve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're creating a trust, spend serious time on this decision. Your successor trustee choice will have enormous impact on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether your wishes are honored</li>
<li>Whether your family experiences conflict or harmony</li>
<li>How efficiently your estate is administered</li>
<li>Whether your beneficiaries are protected</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't make this choice lightly or based solely on emotion or tradition.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Can I name more than one successor trustee?</h3>
<p>Yes. You can name co-trustees who serve together, or successive trustees who serve one at a time. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3>Should I name my oldest child?</h3>
<p>Only if they're actually the best choice. Birth order shouldn't be the primary consideration—capability, trustworthiness, and suitability matter more.</p>
<h3>Can a beneficiary also be trustee?</h3>
<p>Yes, this is very common. However, it creates some potential conflicts of interest that should be addressed in your trust terms.</p>
<h3>What if my first choice doesn't want to serve?</h3>
<p>This is why you should name second and third successor trustees. Also discuss with your first choice before naming them.</p>
<h3>How much does a trustee get paid?</h3>
<p>California law allows "reasonable compensation." Typically 1-2% of trust assets for professional trustees, or hourly rates ($50-$150/hour) for family member trustees. Your trust can specify different amounts.</p>
<h3>Can I name a trust company?</h3>
<p>Yes. Bank trust departments and trust companies are excellent choices for complex estates or situations where no good individual trustee exists.</p>
<h3>What if my trustee steals or mismanages trust assets?</h3>
<p>Trustees are personally liable for breaches of trust. Beneficiaries can sue for damages, removal, and recovery of losses plus attorney fees.</p>
<h3>Can beneficiaries remove a trustee?</h3>
<p>Only if your trust includes provisions allowing removal, or if they petition court and prove the trustee has breached their duties.</p>
<h3>Should my trustee live in California?</h3>
<p>Preferable but not required. California real estate is much easier to manage with a California trustee.</p>
<h3>Can I change my trustee choice after creating my trust?</h3>
<p>Yes! You can amend your revocable living trust at any time to change trustee nominations.</p>
