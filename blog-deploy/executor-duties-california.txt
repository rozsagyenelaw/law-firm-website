7:T95a2,<p>Being named executor of someone's estate is both an honor and a significant responsibility. As a <a href="/locations/glendale.html">Glendale probate attorney</a> who has guided hundreds of executors through California probate, I understand how overwhelming the role can feel, especially when you're grieving the loss of someone you cared about.</p>
<p>The good news? California Probate Code provides clear guidelines for executor duties, and with proper guidance, you can fulfill your responsibilities efficiently and avoid personal liability.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through every executor duty from the moment of death through final distribution, provide detailed checklists, explain your legal responsibilities, and clarify your rights to compensation.</p>
<h2>What Is an Executor?</h2>
<p>An executor (also called "personal representative" in California) is the person named in a will to manage the deceased person's estate through the probate process.</p>
<h3>Executor vs. Administrator</h3>
<p><strong>Executor:</strong> Named in the will
<strong>Administrator:</strong> Appointed by the court when there is no will or the named executor cannot serve</p>
<p>The duties are identical—only the title differs.</p>
<h3>When Do Executor Powers Begin?</h3>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Your authority as executor does not begin automatically when someone dies, even if you're named in their will.</p>
<p><strong>You must:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>File a Petition for Probate with the court</li>
<li>Attend a court hearing</li>
<li>Be formally appointed by the judge</li>
<li>Take an oath of office</li>
<li>Receive Letters Testamentary from the court</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only after receiving Letters Testamentary do you have legal authority to act on behalf of the estate.</strong></p>
<h2>Complete Executor Duties Checklist</h2>
<p>Let me break down your responsibilities into phases, with detailed action items for each stage.</p>
<h2>Phase 1: Immediate Actions After Death (First 2 Weeks)</h2>
<h3>1. Secure the Deceased's Property</h3>
<p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong> Protect estate assets from loss, theft, or damage.</p>
<p><strong>Action items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change locks on the deceased's residence if necessary</li>
<li>Secure valuable personal property (jewelry, art, collectibles)</li>
<li>Ensure adequate insurance coverage on real property</li>
<li>Take possession of important documents (will, deeds, financial records)</li>
<li>Protect business interests if applicable</li>
<li>Secure vehicles and change registration if needed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal standard:</strong> California Probate Code Section 8400 requires executors to use "reasonable care and diligence" in managing estate property.</p>
<p><strong>Liability warning:</strong> You can be held personally liable for losses caused by negligence in securing estate property.</p>
<h3>2. Locate the Original Will</h3>
<p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong> Find and safeguard the original will.</p>
<p><strong>Where to look:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Attorney's office</li>
<li>Bank safe deposit box (you'll need court order for access)</li>
<li>With other important papers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> California requires the original will with original signatures. Photocopies are not acceptable unless the original is proven lost and specific procedures are followed.</p>
<h3>3. Order Death Certificates</h3>
<p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong> Obtain official death certificates.</p>
<p><strong>How many to order:</strong> 10-15 certified copies
<strong>Where to order:</strong> County health department or funeral home

<h2>Executor Compensation in California</h2>
<p>As executor, you're entitled to compensation for your work.</p>
<h3>Statutory Executor Fees</h3>
<p>California Probate Code Section 10800 sets statutory fees based on estate value:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Estate Value</th>
<th>Executor Fee</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>First $100,000</td>
<td>4% ($4,000)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next $100,000</td>
<td>3% ($3,000)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next $800,000</td>
<td>2%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next $9,000,000</td>
<td>1%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next $15,000,000</td>
<td>0.5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Example for $1M estate:</strong> $23,000</p>
<h3>Important Tax Consideration</h3>
<p><strong>Executor fees are taxable income</strong> to you personally (subject to income tax).</p>
<p><strong>Inheritances are tax-free</strong> to beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>If you're also a beneficiary:</strong> Consider waiving executor fees because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees are taxable to you</li>
<li>Fee amount reduces estate value</li>
<li>Reduces your inheritance as well</li>
<li>Usually not worth the tax hit unless you're a minor beneficiary</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extraordinary Compensation</h3>
<p>You can petition for extra compensation beyond statutory fees for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extraordinary services</li>
<li>Unusual complications</li>
<li>Litigation</li>
<li>Business operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Must prove:</strong> Services were outside normal executor duties and provided benefit to estate.</p>
<h2>Executor's Fiduciary Duties</h2>
<p>As executor, you owe fiduciary duties to beneficiaries—the highest duty recognized by law.</p>

<h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>

<p><strong>3. Document everything:</strong> Keep detailed records of all decisions and actions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Communicate with beneficiaries:</strong> Keep them informed and get their input on major decisions.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get insurance:</strong> Consider executor's bond or fiduciary liability insurance.</p>

<p><strong>7. Request receipts:</strong> Get signed receipts from every beneficiary for distributions.</p>
<p><strong>8. Treat estate money as if it's not yours:</strong> Because it isn't.</p>
<h2>When to Decline Appointment as Executor</h2>
<p>Being executor is not mandatory. You can decline if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have time for the extensive responsibilities</li>
<li>You live far away from the estate property</li>
<li>There are family conflicts that make the role impossible</li>
<li>Your own health issues prevent you from serving</li>
<li>You have conflicts of interest</li>
<li>You don't feel capable of handling the duties</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to decline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>File declination with court before appointment</li>
<li>Court will appoint successor named in will</li>
<li>If no successor, court appoints administrator</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No shame in declining:</strong> Better to decline than to serve poorly.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How long does it take to complete executor duties in California?</h3>
<p>The typical California probate process takes 15 to 18 months from filing the petition through final distribution. This timeline includes the initial hearing (6-8 weeks after filing), the 4-month creditor claim period, preparation of inventory and appraisals, payment of debts, and final accounting and distribution. Complex estates with litigation, business interests, or real estate sales can take 2 to 3 years or longer. Estates with independent administration authority generally move faster than those requiring court approval for every action.</p>
<h3>Can I decline to serve as executor if I'm named in the will?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can absolutely decline to serve as executor. Being named in a will does not obligate you to accept the role. Simply file a declination with the court before your formal appointment. The court will then appoint the alternate executor named in the will, or if none exists, will appoint an administrator. There is no shame in declining if you don't have the time, live far away, have health issues, face family conflicts, or simply don't feel capable of handling the responsibilities. It's better to decline than to serve poorly.</p>
<h3>How much does an executor get paid in California?</h3>
<p>California law provides statutory executor compensation based on the gross value of the estate. The fees are 4% of the first $100,000, 3% of the next $100,000, 2% of the next $800,000, 1% of the next $9 million, and 0.5% above that. For a $1 million estate, statutory fees are $23,000. However, executor fees are taxable income to you, while inheritances are tax-free. If you're also a beneficiary, you should usually waive executor fees because the tax burden typically outweighs the benefit.</p>
<h3>What happens if I make a mistake as executor?</h3>
<p>Executors can be held personally liable for breaches of fiduciary duty, including self-dealing, negligence, improper distributions, or failing to pay taxes. If you distribute assets before paying all debts, pay debts out of priority order, or commingle estate funds with personal funds, beneficiaries or creditors can sue you for damages. The best protection is to hire an experienced probate attorney, get court approval for questionable actions, document all decisions thoroughly, communicate regularly with beneficiaries, and never rush important decisions.</p>
<h3>Do I need a lawyer to serve as executor in California?</h3>
<p>While not legally required, hiring a probate attorney is highly advisable, especially for estates over $250,000. California probate is complex and technical, mistakes can result in personal liability, the court will reject incomplete filings, and attorneys protect you from beneficiary disputes. Attorney fees are paid from the estate, not your personal funds, and are based on the same statutory schedule as executor fees. Professional guidance typically expedites the process and prevents costly errors that can far exceed the attorney fees.</p>
