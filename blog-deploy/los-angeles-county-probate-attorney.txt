7:T3b9d,<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> A Los Angeles County probate attorney handles all court filings, deadlines, creditor notifications, and asset distribution — protecting you from personal liability while you focus on your family. With 25+ years of experience at Stanley Mosk Courthouse, I guide executors and families through every step of California probate. Call (818) 291-6217 for a free consultation.</p>
<p>When someone you love dies, the last thing you want to deal with is paperwork, court filings, and legal deadlines. But if they owned property in California — a home, bank accounts, investments — someone has to navigate the probate process.</p>
<p>That "someone" is often a grieving family member who has never set foot in a courthouse.</p>
<p>I'm Rozsa Gyene, a Los Angeles County probate attorney with over 25 years of experience. I've guided hundreds of families through California probate — and I've seen what happens when people try to do it alone.</p>
<p>This article explains exactly what a probate attorney does, why it matters, and how I help families through this difficult time.</p>
<h2>What Does a Probate Attorney Actually Do?</h2>
<p>A probate attorney handles the legal process of transferring a deceased person's assets to their heirs. In California, this involves court filings, strict deadlines, creditor notifications, tax returns, and formal accountings.</p>
<p>Here's what I do for my clients:</p>
<h3>File the Probate Petition</h3>
<p>The probate process begins with a Petition for Probate filed at Stanley Mosk Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles. This isn't a simple form — it requires accurate information about the deceased person's assets, heirs, beneficiaries, and the proposed executor. I prepare and file this petition correctly the first time, avoiding delays from rejected filings.</p>
<h3>Handle All Court Appearances</h3>
<p>Los Angeles County probate requires multiple court hearings. I attend every hearing on your behalf, present the case to the judge, and handle any issues that arise. You don't need to take time off work or navigate the downtown LA courthouse yourself.</p>
<h3>Notify Creditors and Handle Claims</h3>
<p>California law requires formal notification to creditors. I publish the required legal notices, send direct notifications to known creditors, review all claims filed against the estate, and advise you on which claims to pay, reject, or negotiate.</p>
<h3>Prepare the Inventory and Appraisal</h3>
<p>Within 120 days of appointment, the executor must file a complete inventory of all estate assets with court-approved appraisals. I coordinate with the probate referee, ensure accurate valuations, and file the required paperwork on time.</p>
<h3>Manage Estate Administration</h3>
<p>During the 12-18 month probate process, I help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage estate assets</li>
<li>Pay bills and expenses</li>
<li>File required tax returns</li>
<li>Sell real estate if necessary</li>
<li>Keep detailed records of all transactions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prepare Final Accounting and Distribution</h3>
<p>At the end of probate, I prepare a detailed final accounting showing every dollar that came in and went out. I file the Petition for Final Distribution, obtain court approval, and guide you through distributing assets to beneficiaries.</p>
<h2>Why Can't I Just Do Probate Myself?</h2>
<p>Technically, you can represent yourself in California probate. But here's what I've seen happen when people try:</p>
<h3>Rejected Filings and Delays</h3>
<p>California probate forms are complex, and Los Angeles County has specific local rules. A single error can get your petition rejected, adding weeks or months to the process. I've seen cases delayed six months or more because of filing mistakes.</p>
<h3>Missed Deadlines</h3>
<p>Probate has strict deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 days to lodge the will</li>
<li>120 days for inventory</li>
<li>4 months for creditor claims</li>
</ul>
<p>Miss a deadline, and you may face court sanctions, personal liability, or have to start over.</p>
<h3>Personal Liability</h3>
<p>This is the big one. Executors have a fiduciary duty to the estate and beneficiaries. If you make a mistake — pay the wrong creditor, distribute assets too early, miss a tax filing — you can be held personally liable. I've seen executors sued for tens of thousands of dollars for honest mistakes.</p>
<h3>Family Conflicts</h3>
<p>When family members disagree about the estate, things can get ugly fast. Having an attorney as a neutral third party helps keep everyone focused on the legal process rather than old family grievances.</p>
<h2>Why Choose Me as Your Los Angeles Probate Attorney?</h2>

<p>When you hire me, I take the legal burden off your shoulders. You don't have to figure out which forms to file, when to file them, or what to say in court. I handle all of it while keeping you informed every step of the way.</p>

<h2>Common Questions About Hiring a Probate Attorney</h2>
<h3>How much does a probate attorney cost in Los Angeles County?</h3>
<p>California law sets statutory fees for probate attorneys based on the estate's gross value. For a $500,000 estate, the statutory attorney fee is $13,000. For a $1,000,000 estate, it's $23,000. These fees are paid from the estate, not out of your pocket.</p>
<h3>Do I really need an attorney for probate?</h3>
<p>While you can legally represent yourself, California probate is complex with strict deadlines and significant personal liability risks. Most executors find that hiring an attorney provides peace of mind and protects them from costly mistakes.</p>
<h3>What if the estate has no will?</h3>
<p>I handle both testate (with a will) and intestate (without a will) probate cases. When there's no will, California's intestate succession laws determine who inherits. The process is similar, but the court appoints an administrator rather than an executor.</p>
<h3>How long does probate take in Los Angeles County?</h3>
<p>Most Los Angeles County probate cases take 12-18 months from start to finish. Complex estates with litigation, tax issues, or real estate sales can take 2-3 years or longer.</p>
<h3>What if beneficiaries are fighting?</h3>
<p>Family disputes are unfortunately common in probate. As your attorney, I act as a neutral third party focused on following the law and the decedent's wishes. When necessary, I can mediate disputes or represent you in probate litigation.</p>
<h3>Can you help if probate has already been filed?</h3>
<p>Yes. I can take over cases that are already in progress if you're having difficulties with the process or your current attorney. I've helped many clients get probate cases back on track.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How much does a probate attorney cost in Los Angeles County?</h3>
<p>California law sets statutory fees for probate attorneys based on the estate's gross value. For a $500,000 estate, the statutory attorney fee is $13,000. For a $1,000,000 estate, it's $23,000. These fees are paid from the estate, not out of your pocket, and are calculated on a sliding scale set by California Probate Code. The fee structure ensures transparency with no surprise costs.</p>
<h3>Do I really need a probate attorney or can I do it myself?</h3>
<p>While you can legally represent yourself in California probate, the process is complex with strict deadlines, detailed court filings, and significant personal liability risks. I've seen executors face rejected filings causing six-month delays, miss critical deadlines resulting in court sanctions, and become personally liable for tens of thousands of dollars for honest mistakes. Most executors find that hiring an attorney provides peace of mind and protects them from costly errors.</p>
<h3>How long does probate take in Los Angeles County?</h3>
<p>Most Los Angeles County probate cases take 12 to 18 months from start to finish at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Complex estates with litigation, tax issues, or real estate sales can take 2 to 3 years or longer. The timeline includes filing the petition, court hearings, creditor notification periods, inventory and appraisal preparation, asset management, and final accounting and distribution.</p>
<h3>What happens if there is no will?</h3>
<p>I handle both testate cases with a will and intestate cases without a will. When there's no will, California's intestate succession laws determine who inherits based on family relationships. The probate process is similar, but the court appoints an administrator rather than an executor. The administrator has the same duties and responsibilities as an executor would have.</p>
<h3>Can you take over a probate case that's already been filed?</h3>
<p>Yes, I can take over probate cases that are already in progress if you're having difficulties with the process or your current attorney. I've helped many clients get probate cases back on track after filing errors, missed deadlines, or lack of communication. Contact me to discuss your situation and how I can help move your case forward efficiently.</p>
