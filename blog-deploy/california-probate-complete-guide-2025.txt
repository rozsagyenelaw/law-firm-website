7:T1995,<h1>California Probate Administration 2025: A Guide to the Stanley Mosk &#x26; Pasadena Courts</h1>
<h2>Navigating the Los Angeles Probate Backlog</h2>
<p>If you have recently lost a loved one in Glendale, Burbank, or Pasadena, you are likely dealing with the <strong>Stanley Mosk Courthouse</strong> or the <strong>Pasadena Probate Department</strong>. As a <a href="/probate-attorney-glendale">probate attorney in Glendale</a> with over 25 years of experience, I've seen how the 2025 court delays can freeze a family's assets.</p>
<p>Whether you are seeking <strong>Letters of Administration</strong> because there was no will, or you are an Executor named in a testament, this guide explains how to protect the estate's value from statutory fees and court delays.</p>
<h2>How Much Does Probate Cost in California? (2025 Statutory Fees)</h2>
<p>California is unique because attorney and executor fees are set by <strong>California Probate Code §10800</strong>. These fees are calculated on the <em>gross value</em> of the estate, meaning mortgages and debts are not subtracted before the percentage is applied.</p>
<h3>The Statutory Fee Schedule</h3>
<p>The attorney and the executor are <em>each</em> entitled to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4%</strong> of the first $100,000</li>
<li><strong>3%</strong> of the next $100,000</li>
<li><strong>2%</strong> of the next $800,000</li>
<li><strong>1%</strong> of the next $9,000,000</li>
</ul>
<p>For a standard <strong>$1,000,000 Glendale home</strong>, the combined statutory fees for the attorney and executor total <strong>$46,000</strong>.</p>
<h3>California Probate Fee Calculator 2025</h3>
<h2>The 7-Step Probate Administration Roadmap</h2>
<p>To settle an estate in Los Angeles County, you must follow a strict procedural timeline. Missing a single filing can add six months to your case.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Filing the Petition (DE-111):</strong> Lodging the will and requesting the appointment of a Personal Representative.</li>
<li><strong>Notice of Petition:</strong> Publishing notice in the <em>Glendale Independent</em> or <em>Burbank Leader</em> to alert creditors.</li>
<li><strong>Issuance of Letters:</strong> Obtaining <strong>Letters Testamentary</strong> from the judge to gain access to bank accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory &#x26; Appraisal:</strong> Submitting assets to a court-appointed <strong>Probate Referee</strong> to determine fair market value.</li>
<li><strong>Creditor Claims Period:</strong> A mandatory 4-month window for debts to be filed.</li>
<li><strong>Final Accounting:</strong> A detailed report of every dollar spent and earned by the estate.</li>
<li><strong>Order of Distribution:</strong> The judge signs the order to transfer titles to the heirs.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The "Big Money" Shortcut: The IAEA</h2>
<p>The most important term an Executor should know in 2025 is the <strong>Independent Administration of Estates Act (IAEA)</strong>. When we petition for "Full Authority" under the IAEA, we can often sell real estate in Magnolia Park or the Rancho District without waiting for a court confirmation hearing. This allows you to close escrow in 30 days rather than 6 months.</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="/probate">executor authority to sell property</a> and how the IAEA can expedite your case.</p>
<h2>New 2025 Probate Limits (AB 2016)</h2>
<p>As of April 1, 2025, California has updated the thresholds for simplified procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Estate Affidavit:</strong> Now <strong>$208,850</strong> for personal property.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Residence Limit:</strong> Under AB 2016, primary residences valued up to <strong>$750,000</strong> may qualify for a simplified transfer, though most homes in the San Fernando Valley still exceed this limit and require full probate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Avoid Probate: The $575 Solution</h2>
<p>While probate is a vital service, it is a "voluntary" tax. By establishing an <a href="/">affordable $575 living trust package</a>, you ensure your family skips the Stanley Mosk Courthouse entirely.</p>
