While LegalZoom costs $299-$599 for basic documents, you still need to add deed preparation ($149+), don't receive personalized legal advice, and risk creating an unfunded trust that fails to avoid probate. Our attorney-prepared packages start at just $575 and include everything: personalized legal advice, all essential documents, deed transfer for your home, and ongoing support.</p>
<p>If you're researching living trusts in California, you've probably noticed that LegalZoom and similar online services advertise temptingly low prices. But before you click "buy," it's worth understanding exactly what you're getting—and what you're not getting—compared to working with an experienced estate planning attorney.</p>
<p>As a Glendale estate planning attorney who has reviewed (and often had to fix) dozens of LegalZoom trusts over my 25+ year career, I want to give you an honest, detailed comparison so you can make the right choice for your family.</p>
<h2>The Real Cost Comparison: Attorney vs LegalZoom</h2>
<p>Let's start with what everyone wants to know: the money. But the true comparison isn't as simple as LegalZoom's advertised prices suggest.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>But here's what they don't prominently advertise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deed preparation: $149 per deed (you need this to transfer your home)</li>
<li>Attorney review add-on: $199</li>
<li>Trust amendments: $99-$199 each</li>
<li>Annual updates: $199/year subscription</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> When you factor in everything a California homeowner actually needs, our attorney-prepared packages often cost the same or less than LegalZoom—while providing exponentially more value.</p>
<h2>What LegalZoom Gets Right</h2>
<p>To be fair, let's acknowledge what LegalZoom does well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> You can complete everything from home, on your own schedule</li>
<li><strong>Low barrier to entry:</strong> The basic price point makes people actually do something</li>
<li><strong>User-friendly interface:</strong> Their questionnaire is well-designed</li>
<li><strong>Brand recognition:</strong> They've made estate planning more accessible to the general public</li>
<li><strong>Basic documentation:</strong> For very simple situations, the documents can work</li>
</ul>
<h2>What LegalZoom Gets Wrong (and Why It Matters)</h2>
<p>Now for the critical issues that often don't become apparent until it's too late:</p>
<h3>1. No Personalized Legal Advice</h3>
<p>LegalZoom explicitly states they are not a law firm and cannot provide legal advice. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one analyzes your specific situation</li>
<li>No one identifies potential problems with your plan</li>
<li>No one suggests strategies you might not know about</li>
<li>No one ensures your documents actually accomplish your goals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real example from my practice:</strong> A client came to me with a LegalZoom trust that named her minor children as direct beneficiaries. When she passed away, her 10-year-old would have received $200,000 outright at age 18. She had no idea this was a problem—LegalZoom's questionnaire never asked about age-restricted distributions.</p>
<h3>2. The Unfunded Trust Problem</h3>
<p>This is the biggest issue I see. A living trust only avoids probate if your assets are properly transferred into it—a process called "funding." LegalZoom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives you general instructions about funding</li>
<li>Doesn't actually transfer your real estate (unless you pay extra)</li>
<li>Doesn't follow up to ensure funding is complete</li>
<li>Doesn't review your beneficiary designations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The devastating result:</strong> Approximately 70% of DIY and online trusts I've reviewed are improperly funded. When these people die, their families still face probate—exactly what the trust was supposed to prevent.</p>
<h3>3. Generic, One-Size-Fits-All Documents</h3>
<p>LegalZoom uses templates modified by your questionnaire answers. But estate planning isn't one-size-fits-all:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>California community property rules</strong> require specific provisions that may not be included in generic templates</li>
<li><strong>Prop 19 implications</strong> for property tax reassessment aren't addressed</li>
<li><strong>Specific family situations</strong> (blended families, special needs, estranged relatives) require customized language</li>
<li><strong>Asset protection concerns</strong> often aren't considered</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. No Ongoing Relationship</h3>
<p>Your estate plan isn't a "set it and forget it" document. Life changes—and your trust should change with it. LegalZoom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't reach out when laws change</li>
<li>Charges additional fees for updates</li>
<li>Has no one who knows your situation to call</li>
</ul>
<p>When you work with an attorney, you have someone who knows your family, understands your goals, and can help you adapt as life evolves.</p>
<h3>5. No One to Call When Something Goes Wrong</h3>
<p>After someone dies, families need help understanding and administering the trust. With LegalZoom:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no attorney who drafted the documents to explain intent</li>
<li>Customer service can't provide legal guidance</li>
<li>Your family may need to hire an attorney anyway—at litigation rates</li>
</ul>
<h2>When LegalZoom Might Be Acceptable</h2>
<p>In the interest of honesty, there are limited situations where LegalZoom could work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very simple situations:</strong> Single person, no children, renting (no real estate), minimal assets, standard distribution to one or two beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong>Short-term solution:</strong> You need something basic immediately and plan to upgrade to proper planning later</li>
<li><strong>Budget is the only factor:</strong> Some protection is better than none, though the cost difference isn't as large as perceived</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>However, even in these situations,</strong> our $575 package provides far more value at a comparable price point.</p>
<h2>When You Absolutely Need an Attorney</h2>
<p>Do not use LegalZoom if any of these apply to you:</p>
<h3>Real Estate Ownership</h3>
<p>If you own a home in California (or anywhere), you need an attorney. Deed transfers must be done correctly to avoid title issues, reassessment problems, and ensuring the property actually transfers to your trust.</p>
<h3>Minor Children</h3>
<p>Protecting your children requires careful guardian nominations, age-appropriate distribution provisions, and trust protections that generic documents don't provide.</p>
<h3>Blended Families</h3>
<p>Second marriages, stepchildren, and children from prior relationships require careful planning to balance competing interests and prevent disputes.</p>
<h3>Business Ownership</h3>
<p>Business succession planning requires specialized knowledge that online services can't provide.</p>
<h3>Significant Assets</h3>
<p>If your estate is worth more than $500,000, the stakes are too high for generic documents.</p>
<h3>Complex Family Dynamics</h3>
<p>Estranged family members, potential challenges, unequal distributions—these all require careful drafting.</p>
<h3>Special Needs Beneficiaries</h3>
<p>A beneficiary receiving government benefits requires a special needs trust—and doing this wrong can be catastrophic.</p>
<h3>Tax Planning Needs</h3>
<p>Estate tax planning, capital gains considerations, and income tax planning require professional guidance.</p>
<h3>Multiple State Property</h3>
<p>Property in multiple states requires careful analysis of each state's laws.</p>
<h2>What Happens When LegalZoom Goes Wrong</h2>
<p>I've seen the aftermath of problematic LegalZoom trusts many times. Here are real scenarios:</p>
<h3>The Unfunded Trust Disaster</h3>
<p>A family came to me after their mother died. She had a LegalZoom trust but never transferred her house into it. Result: Full probate, $35,000 in fees, and 18 months of court proceedings. The trust was worthless.</p>
<h3>The Missing Contingency</h3>
<p>A couple's LegalZoom trust left everything to each other, then to their children equally. But what if they died together? The trust had no contingency. When they died in a car accident, a court had to determine distribution—adding months and thousands in legal fees.</p>
<h3>The Disinheritance Accident</h3>
<p>A man used LegalZoom after his second marriage, intending to provide for his new wife while ultimately passing assets to his children from his first marriage. The generic language gave his wife everything outright—when she died years later, her family inherited, and his children got nothing.</p>
<h2>The Attorney Advantage: What You Actually Get</h2>
<p>When you work with our firm, here's what the experience looks like:</p>

<p>Your trust is drafted specifically for your situation—not generated from a template. Every provision is intentional and tailored to your family.</p>
<h3>Complete Funding</h3>
<p>We prepare the deed to transfer your home and guide you through funding all other assets. Your trust will actually work when you need it.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Document Package</h3>
<p>You receive all essential documents, properly executed and organized.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I explain how everything works so you understand your own estate plan.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Relationship</h3>
<p>You have an attorney who knows you and can help when questions arise or life changes.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Is LegalZoom good for living trusts in California?</h3>
<p>LegalZoom can work for very simple situations: single individuals with straightforward assets, no real estate, no minor children, and no complex family dynamics. However, for most California families—especially homeowners—the limitations become problematic. LegalZoom doesn't provide personalized legal advice, doesn't ensure your trust is properly funded, and may not address California-specific requirements.</p>
<h3>How much does LegalZoom charge for a living trust vs an attorney?</h3>
<p>LegalZoom's living trust packages range from $299-$599 for the basic document. However, add-ons like deed preparation ($149), document review, and updates can push costs to $800+. Our attorney-prepared living trust packages start at $575 for individuals and $675 for married couples, including deed transfer, personalized legal advice, and all essential documents—making the total cost comparable while providing far more value.</p>
<h3>What are the risks of using LegalZoom for a living trust?</h3>
<p>The main risks include: unfunded trusts (your assets aren't properly transferred into the trust), generic documents that don't address your specific situation, no California-specific guidance, missing important provisions, and no one to answer questions when issues arise. These problems often aren't discovered until after death, when your family faces expensive probate or litigation.</p>
<h3>When should I definitely use an attorney instead of LegalZoom?</h3>
<p>You should use an attorney if you: own California real estate, have minor children, have a blended family, own a business, have significant assets, want to disinherit someone, have a special needs family member, own property in multiple states, have complex tax considerations, or want asset protection planning. An attorney ensures your trust actually accomplishes your goals.</p>
<h3>Can I start with LegalZoom and have an attorney review it?</h3>
<p>While possible, this approach often costs more than starting with an attorney. Most attorneys charge $200-500 to review a LegalZoom trust, and many find significant issues requiring a complete redo. Combined with LegalZoom's fees, you may spend more than working with an affordable attorney from the start. Our firm offers complete living trust packages from $575 that include proper drafting, funding assistance, and personalized advice.</p>
<h2>Making Your Decision</h2>
<p>Here's my honest advice:</p>
<p><strong>If you own a home in California, have children, or have any complexity in your family or finances, work with an attorney.</strong> The cost difference is minimal when you compare apples to apples, and the value difference is enormous.</p>
<p>Our $575-$675 packages provide everything you need, including the personalized attention and professional expertise that online services simply cannot match.</p>

However, for most California families—especially homeowners—the limitations become problematic. LegalZoom doesn't provide personalized legal advice, doesn't ensure your trust is properly funded, and may not address California-specific requirements."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does LegalZoom charge for a living trust vs an attorney?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"LegalZoom's living trust packages range from $299-$599 for the basic document. However, add-ons like deed preparation ($149), document review, and updates can push costs to $800+. Our attorney-prepared living trust packages start at $575 for individuals and $675 for married couples, including deed transfer, personalized legal advice, and all essential documents—making the total cost comparable while providing far more value."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the risks of using LegalZoom for a living trust?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The main risks include: unfunded trusts (your assets aren't properly transferred into the trust), generic documents that don't address your specific situation, no California-specific guidance, missing important provisions, and no one to answer questions when issues arise. These problems often aren't discovered until after death, when your family faces expensive probate or litigation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When should I definitely use an attorney instead of LegalZoom?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You should use an attorney if you: own California real estate, have minor children, have a blended family, own a business, have significant assets, want to disinherit someone, have a special needs family member, own property in multiple states, have complex tax considerations, or want asset protection planning. An attorney ensures your trust actually accomplishes your goals."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I start with LegalZoom and have an attorney review it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While possible, this approach often costs more than starting with an attorney. Most attorneys charge $200-500 to review a LegalZoom trust, and many find significant issues requiring a complete redo. Combined with LegalZoom's fees, you may spend more than working with an affordable attorney from the start. Our firm offers complete living trust packages from $575 that include proper drafting, funding assistance, and personalized advice."}}]}</script></div></main><footer class="bg-primary-blue text-white mt-20 no-print"><div class="container-custom py-12"><div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8"><div><h3 class="font-playfair text-2xl mb-4">Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene</h3><p class="text-white/80 mb-4">Over 25 years of experience serving Los Angeles County families with comprehensive estate planning and trust services.</p></div><div><h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4 text-accent-gold">Contact</h4><div class="space-y-2 text-white/80"><p>450 N Brand Blvd Ste 600</p><p>Glendale, CA 91203</p><p class="mt-4"><a href="tel:8182916217" class="text-accent-gold hover:underline">(818) 291-6217</a></p></div></div><div><h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4 text-accent-gold">Practice Areas</h4><ul class="space-y-2 text-white/80"><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/living-trusts.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Living Trusts</a></li><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/probate.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Probate</a></li><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/trust-administration.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Trust Administration</a></li><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/conservatorship.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Conservatorship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="border-t border-white/10 mt-8 pt-8 text-center text-white/70 text-sm"><p>© <!-- -->2025<!-- --> Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene.

However, for most California families—especially homeowners—the limitations become problematic. LegalZoom doesn't provide personalized legal advice, doesn't ensure your trust is properly funded, and may not address California-specific requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow much does LegalZoom charge for a living trust vs an attorney?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegalZoom's living trust packages range from $299-$599 for the basic document. However, add-ons like deed preparation ($149), document review, and updates can push costs to $800+. Our attorney-prepared living trust packages start at $575 for individuals and $675 for married couples, including deed transfer, personalized legal advice, and all essential documents—making the total cost comparable while providing far more value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat are the risks of using LegalZoom for a living trust?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main risks include: unfunded trusts (your assets aren't properly transferred into the trust), generic documents that don't address your specific situation, no California-specific guidance, missing important provisions, and no one to answer questions when issues arise. These problems often aren't discovered until after death, when your family faces expensive probate or litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhen should I definitely use an attorney instead of LegalZoom?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should use an attorney if you: own California real estate, have minor children, have a blended family, own a business, have significant assets, want to disinherit someone, have a special needs family member, own property in multiple states, have complex tax considerations, or want asset protection planning. An attorney ensures your trust actually accomplishes your goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCan I start with LegalZoom and have an attorney review it?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile possible, this approach often costs more than starting with an attorney. Most attorneys charge $200-500 to review a LegalZoom trust, and many find significant issues requiring a complete redo. Combined with LegalZoom's fees, you may spend more than working with an affordable attorney from the start. Our firm offers complete living trust packages from $575 that include proper drafting, funding assistance, and personalized advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMaking Your Decision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's my honest advice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you own a home in California, have children, or have any complexity in your family or finances, work with an attorney.\u003c/strong\u003e The cost difference is minimal when you compare apples to apples, and the value difference is enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur $575-$675 packages provide everything you need, including the personalized attention and professional expertise that online services simply cannot match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSchedule Your Free Consultation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill not sure which option is right for you?
