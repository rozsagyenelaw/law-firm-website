7:T6a80,<p>You created your living trust years ago, filed it away, and haven't thought about it since. That's exactly what most people do—and it's a costly mistake that can undermine everything you worked to accomplish.</p>
<p>As a Glendale estate planning attorney who regularly helps families navigate trust administration and litigation, I see the same problem repeatedly: trusts that no longer reflect the family's current reality. Children are born. Marriages end. Property is sold. Beneficiaries die. Tax laws change. Yet the trust remains frozen in time.</p>
<p>The result? Family conflicts, unintended beneficiaries, litigation, and outcomes the person who created the trust never wanted.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain exactly when you should update your California living trust, how the amendment process works, what it costs, and the serious consequences of letting your trust become outdated.</p>
<h2>Why Living Trusts Require Regular Updates</h2>
<p>Unlike a will that sits dormant until you die, your living trust is a living document that should evolve with your life circumstances. California law allows you to amend your revocable living trust at any time while you're alive and competent—but you have to actually do it.</p>
<h3>The Problem with "Set It and Forget It"</h3>
<p>I recently worked with a family whose father created a trust in 1998, shortly after his divorce. The trust left everything equally to his three children. Sounds fair, right?</p>
<p>Here's what changed over 25 years:</p>
<ul>
<li>He remarried in 2002 (never updated trust to include new wife)</li>
<li>One daughter predeceased him in 2015 (trust didn't address this)</li>
<li>He sold his Pasadena home and bought in Glendale in 2010 (property schedules never updated)</li>
<li>He opened new bank accounts (never titled in trust name)</li>
<li>California estate tax laws changed significantly</li>
</ul>
<p>The result? A two-year legal battle, $180,000 in litigation costs, family relationships permanently destroyed, and outcomes that contradicted what he told his family he wanted.</p>
<p>All of this could have been prevented with periodic trust reviews and updates.</p>
<h2>11 Life Events That Require Trust Updates</h2>
<p>Let me walk you through the specific situations when you absolutely must review and likely amend your California living trust.</p>
<h3>1. Marriage or Remarriage</h3>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong>
California is a community property state. When you marry, any assets acquired during the marriage generally become community property—owned 50/50 with your spouse, regardless of whose name is on the title.</p>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add provisions for your new spouse</li>
<li>Clarify which assets are community vs. separate property</li>
<li>Consider creating separate trusts for separate property</li>
<li>Update beneficiary designations</li>
<li>Revise distribution plans to balance needs of new spouse and children from prior relationships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-World Issue:</strong>
If you remarry and don't update your trust, California law gives your surviving spouse certain rights that may conflict with your trust terms. This creates litigation—exactly what you created a trust to avoid.</p>
<h3>2. Divorce or Legal Separation</h3>
<p><strong>Critical Timing:</strong>
California Family Code Section 6122.5 automatically revokes provisions in your trust benefiting your former spouse once the divorce is final. However, don't rely on this automatic revocation—it creates ambiguity and potential litigation.</p>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove ex-spouse as beneficiary</li>
<li>Remove ex-spouse as trustee or successor trustee</li>
<li>Revise distribution plans</li>
<li>Update guardian nominations for minor children</li>
<li>Revise property schedules to reflect division of assets</li>
<li>Update powers of attorney and healthcare directives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Make these changes as soon as the divorce is final. Don't wait.</p>
<h3>3. Birth or Adoption of Children or Grandchildren</h3>
<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong>
Your trust likely doesn't automatically include children born or adopted after you created it unless you included specific language anticipating this.</p>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add new children as beneficiaries</li>
<li>Update distribution percentages</li>
<li>Establish age-based distributions (money held until they reach certain ages)</li>
<li>Nominate guardians if children are minors</li>
<li>Consider creating educational trusts</li>
<li>Add provisions for special needs if applicable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California Law Nuance:</strong>
California Probate Code Section 21620 provides some protection for "pretermitted children" (unintentionally omitted), but it's far better to explicitly update your trust than rely on court interpretation.</p>
<h3>4. Death of a Beneficiary</h3>
<p><strong>What Happens:</strong>
If a named beneficiary dies before you and you haven't updated your trust, what happens to their share depends on your trust language.</p>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove deceased beneficiary</li>
<li>Redistribute their share among remaining beneficiaries</li>
<li>Clarify whether deceased beneficiary's children inherit their parent's share (per stirpes distribution)</li>
<li>Update successor beneficiary designations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Issue:</strong>
I often see trusts with three children as equal beneficiaries. One child dies. Parents never update the trust. When the second parent dies, does the deceased child's share go to their children, or is it split between the two surviving siblings? Without clear trust language, this creates family disputes.</p>
<h3>5. Change in Trustee Circumstances</h3>
<p><strong>When to Act:</strong>
Your chosen trustee or successor trustees may become unable or unwilling to serve due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Death</li>
<li>Serious illness or incapacity</li>
<li>Moving out of state</li>
<li>Deteriorating relationship</li>
<li>Changed life circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Name new successor trustees</li>
<li>Update trustee compensation terms</li>
<li>Add co-trustees if appropriate</li>
<li>Revise trustee powers or restrictions</li>
<li>Consider corporate trustee for complex estates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Consideration:</strong>
The person you named as successor trustee 15 years ago may no longer be the right choice. Your responsible 30-year-old daughter is now a busy executive living in New York with three kids. Your brother who was financially savvy now has his own health issues. Regular review ensures your trustee nominations remain appropriate.</p>
<h3>6. Significant Change in Assets</h3>
<p><strong>Scenarios Requiring Updates:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Major Asset Increases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance received</li>
<li>Business sale</li>
<li>Real estate appreciation</li>
<li>Investment gains</li>
<li>Retirement account growth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Asset Decreases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Business losses</li>
<li>Market downturns</li>
<li>Property sales</li>
<li>Medical expenses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Property schedules (Schedule A for real property, Schedule B for personal property)</li>
<li>Distribution percentages if they're based on specific dollar amounts</li>
<li>Trustee powers for new asset types (business interests, real estate investments, etc.)</li>
<li>Consider tax planning for larger estates</li>
<li>Add specific bequest provisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical Issue in California:</strong>
Los Angeles County home values have increased dramatically. A Glendale home purchased for $300,000 in 2000 might be worth $1.2 million today. Your trust distribution plan that seemed fair 20 years ago might create significant imbalances now.</p>
<h3>7. Purchase or Sale of Real Estate</h3>
<p><strong>Why This Is Critical:</strong>
Real estate is typically your largest asset and the primary reason you created a trust—to avoid probate on California real property.</p>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule A (real property schedule) to add new properties or remove sold ones</li>
<li>Update addresses</li>
<li>Add provisions for managing rental property or vacation homes</li>
<li>Consider creating separate trusts for property in different states</li>
<li>Update distribution plans if property values significantly affect inheritance balance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Mistake:</strong>
You buy a new home and title it in your name instead of your trust name, thinking you'll transfer it later. You never do. That property goes through probate, defeating the entire purpose of your trust.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase property in trust name, OR</li>
<li>Immediately deed property to trust after purchase</li>
<li>Update Schedule A to list the property</li>
<li>Amend trust if the new property significantly changes your estate plan</li>
</ol>
<h3>8. Moving to or from California</h3>
<p><strong>California → Another State:</strong></p>
<p>Different states have different trust laws, community property rules, and estate tax thresholds. Your California trust may not work optimally in your new state.</p>
<p><strong>What to Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether your new state recognizes California community property</li>
<li>Different trust formalities or requirements</li>
<li>State estate taxes (California has none; many states do)</li>
<li>Whether to create a new trust under new state law</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Another State → California:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What to Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure trust complies with California law</li>
<li>Address community property issues</li>
<li>Update to reference California Probate Code</li>
<li>Consider California-specific planning opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Changes in Federal or State Law</h3>
<p><strong>Recent California Law Changes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>2023-2024 Updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>California estate tax exemption (none—California has no estate tax)</li>
<li>Federal estate tax exemption (currently $13.61 million per person for 2024, but scheduled to drop in 2026)</li>
<li>Trust transparency requirements</li>
<li>Beneficiary notification rules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Laws Change:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tax exemptions increase or decrease</li>
<li>New trust reporting requirements enacted</li>
<li>Probate procedures modified</li>
<li>Elder law protections change</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Do:</strong>
Schedule periodic reviews with your estate planning attorney (I recommend every 3-5 years) to ensure your trust takes advantage of current laws and complies with new requirements.</p>
<h3>10. Change in Relationship with Beneficiaries</h3>
<p>This is uncomfortable to discuss, but it's reality:</p>
<p><strong>Situations Requiring Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Estrangement from a child or family member</li>
<li>Beneficiary develops substance abuse issues</li>
<li>Beneficiary demonstrates financial irresponsibility</li>
<li>Beneficiary's marriage creates concerns about assets leaving the family</li>
<li>You develop closer relationships with people not included in your trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disinheriting or reducing distributions to certain beneficiaries</li>
<li>Adding protective trusts for beneficiaries with substance abuse or financial issues</li>
<li>Creating incentive provisions</li>
<li>Adding spendthrift provisions</li>
<li>Equalizing distributions among all beneficiaries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California Law Protection:</strong>
You have broad discretion to distribute your trust assets as you wish (with community property limitations for spouses). However, clearly documenting your intent helps prevent will contests based on claims of undue influence or lack of capacity.</p>
<h3>11. Special Circumstances</h3>
<p><strong>Additional Situations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beneficiary Develops Special Needs:</strong>
Create a special needs trust to preserve government benefit eligibility while supplementing their care.</p>
<p><strong>Starting or Selling a Business:</strong>
Update trust to address business succession, valuation, and management.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming a Caregiver:</strong>
Add provisions for compensation or larger distributions to children providing your care.</p>
<p><strong>Health Decline:</strong>
Ensure trustee succession plan accounts for your potential incapacity.</p>
<p><strong>Charitable Intent Changes:</strong>
Add or modify charitable bequests.</p>
<h2>How to Update Your California Living Trust</h2>
<p>There are three ways to modify your living trust in California:</p>
<h3>1. Trust Amendment (Most Common)</h3>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong>
For specific, limited changes—updating beneficiaries, changing trustees, revising particular provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Draft amendment document referencing original trust</li>
<li>Sign and date amendment</li>
<li>Notarize (recommended but not required for revocable trusts)</li>
<li>Keep with original trust document</li>
<li>Provide copy to successor trustees</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Less expensive than full restatement</li>
<li>Quick and simple for minor changes</li>
<li>Creates clear record of what changed and when</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical Cost:</strong>
$500-$1,500 depending on complexity</p>
<h3>2. Trust Restatement (For Major Changes)</h3>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple significant changes needed</li>
<li>Trust is very old and needs comprehensive update</li>
<li>You've made several amendments and want to consolidate</li>
<li>Changing fundamental trust structure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create completely new trust document</li>
<li>Maintain original trust name and date</li>
<li>Replace all previous terms with new provisions</li>
<li>Sign, date, and notarize</li>
<li>No need to retitle assets (trust name stays the same)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean, consolidated document</li>
<li>Easier for trustees to administer</li>
<li>Avoids confusion from multiple amendments</li>
<li>Opportunity for comprehensive review</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical Cost:</strong>
$1,500-$3,500 depending on complexity</p>
<h3>3. Revocation and New Trust (Rarely Needed)</h3>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Want to completely change trust structure</li>
<li>Creating separate trusts for separate property</li>
<li>Significant change in circumstances requiring fresh start</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Execute revocation document</li>
<li>Create entirely new trust</li>
<li>Retitle all assets from old trust to new trust</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires retitling all assets</li>
<li>More expensive and time-consuming</li>
<li>Generally unnecessary for revocable trusts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When It Makes Sense:</strong>
Primarily for irrevocable trusts or when combining/separating trusts.</p>
<h2>The Trust Amendment Process: Step-by-Step</h2>
<p>Let me walk you through exactly how to amend your California living trust:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Locate Your Original Trust</h3>
<p>You'd be surprised how many people can't find their trust document. Check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home safe</li>
<li>Safety deposit box</li>
<li>With your attorney</li>
<li>With your trustee</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't Have It?</strong>
Your attorney should have a copy. If your attorney is unavailable, you may need to reconstruct the trust or create a new one.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Review Current Trust Terms</h3>
<p>Read through your entire trust document to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current beneficiaries and distribution plans</li>
<li>Current trustees</li>
<li>Property schedules</li>
<li>Special provisions</li>
<li>What exactly needs to change</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Consult an Estate Planning Attorney</h3>
<p><strong>Why You Need an Attorney:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure amendment accomplishes your goals</li>
<li>Avoid creating ambiguities or conflicts</li>
<li>Address tax implications</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with California law</li>
<li>Consider issues you might not anticipate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DIY Amendments:</strong>
While California allows you to amend your own trust, I strongly advise against it. I've seen countless cases where well-intentioned DIY amendments created ambiguities, conflicts with other trust provisions, or didn't actually accomplish what the person intended.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Execute the Amendment</h3>
<p><strong>Required Formalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amendment must be in writing</li>
<li>Must clearly reference the original trust</li>
<li>Must be signed by you (the grantor/settlor)</li>
<li>Should be dated</li>
<li>Notarization recommended (not required for revocable trusts)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If You Have Co-Trustees:</strong>
Both grantors must sign if you created a joint trust.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Update Property Schedules</h3>
<p>If you're adding or removing assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update Schedule A (real property)</li>
<li>Update Schedule B (personal property)</li>
<li>Ensure actual asset titles match</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Store with Original Trust</h3>
<p>Keep amendment with original trust document so your successor trustee can find both.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Inform Relevant Parties</h3>
<p><strong>Consider Notifying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Successor trustees (so they know updated version exists)</li>
<li>Your attorney (provide copy for their files)</li>
<li>Anyone with a copy of original trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't Generally Need to Notify:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beneficiaries (you can, but it's not required)</li>
<li>Financial institutions</li>
<li>Title companies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 8: Update Related Documents</h3>
<p>If your trust changes affect related documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour-over will</li>
<li>Powers of attorney</li>
<li>Healthcare directives</li>
<li>Beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and life insurance</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Happens If You Don't Update Your Trust</h2>
<p>The consequences of an outdated trust can be severe:</p>
<h3>1. Unintended Beneficiaries</h3>
<p><strong>Real Example:</strong>
Client divorced in 2010, died in 2023 with trust still naming ex-spouse as beneficiary. While California law revoked the ex-spouse provision, it created ambiguity requiring court interpretation, legal fees, and family conflict.</p>
<h3>2. Assets Outside the Trust</h3>
<p>Property acquired after trust creation but not added to trust goes through probate—defeating the entire purpose.</p>
<h3>3. Inappropriate Trustees</h3>
<p>The person you named 20 years ago may no longer be the right choice due to health, relationship changes, or relocation.</p>
<h3>4. Tax Inefficiencies</h3>
<p>Outdated trusts miss tax-saving opportunities or include provisions for tax laws that no longer exist.</p>
<h3>5. Family Litigation</h3>
<p>Ambiguities and outdated provisions are the #1 source of trust litigation. I've represented families in disputes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars—all caused by trusts that weren't updated.</p>
<h3>6. Distribution Plans That No Longer Make Sense</h3>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Trust created when your estate was $200,000 leaves specific dollar amounts to each child. Estate grows to $2 million. Specific dollar bequests now create massive imbalances you never intended.</p>
<h3>7. Failure to Address New Family Members</h3>
<p>Children or grandchildren born after trust creation may be inadvertently omitted.</p>
<h2>How Often Should You Review Your Trust?</h2>
<p><strong>My Recommendation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Formal Attorney Review:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every 3-5 years minimum</li>
<li>After any major life event</li>
<li>When California or federal laws change significantly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal Review:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annually (read through it, confirm it still reflects your wishes)</li>
<li>Update property schedules as you buy/sell assets</li>
<li>Review beneficiary designations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signs You Need Immediate Review:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can't remember what's in your trust</li>
<li>Trust is more than 10 years old and never amended</li>
<li>Any of the 11 life events discussed above occurred</li>
<li>You've moved</li>
<li>Tax laws changed</li>
<li>Your family situation changed</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Cost of Trust Updates</h2>
<p>Understanding what you'll pay helps you budget for proper maintenance:</p>
<p><strong>Simple Amendment:</strong>
$500-$1,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Change one trustee</li>
<li>Update one beneficiary</li>
<li>Minor distribution change</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moderate Amendment:</strong>
$1,000-$2,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple beneficiary changes</li>
<li>Update property schedules</li>
<li>Revise distribution plan</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complex Amendment:</strong>
$2,000-$3,500</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant structural changes</li>
<li>Tax planning provisions</li>
<li>Special needs trust provisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Full Restatement:</strong>
$1,500-$4,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive update</li>
<li>Consolidate multiple amendments</li>
<li>Modernize language and provisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compare to Litigation Costs:</strong>
Trust litigation over ambiguities or outdated provisions: $50,000-$300,000+</p>
<p>The cost of keeping your trust updated is a fraction of the cost of fixing problems after you're gone.</p>
<h2>Common Trust Amendment Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3>1. Handwritten Changes on Original Trust</h3>
<p><strong>Never</strong> write changes directly on your trust document. This creates ambiguity about what the "real" trust says and can invalidate provisions.</p>
<h3>2. Verbal Trust Changes</h3>
<p>Telling your family "I'm changing my trust to..." accomplishes nothing. Changes must be in writing.</p>
<h3>3. Inconsistent Amendments</h3>
<p>Making multiple amendments without ensuring they don't conflict with each other or original trust terms.</p>
<h3>4. Forgetting to Update Property Schedules</h3>
<p>Amending beneficiaries but forgetting to add newly acquired property to Schedule A means that property goes through probate.</p>
<h3>5. Not Updating Related Documents</h3>
<p>Amending your trust but forgetting to update your pour-over will, powers of attorney, or beneficiary designations creates conflicts.</p>
<h3>6. Failing to Execute Properly</h3>
<p>Forgetting to sign, date, or notarize the amendment.</p>
<h3>7. DIY Amendments Without Legal Review</h3>
<p>Using online forms without understanding California-specific requirements or implications.</p>
<h2>Special Situations: When Amendment Isn't Possible</h2>
<h3>If You Become Incapacitated</h3>
<p>Once you lack legal capacity, you can no longer amend your trust. This is why advance planning is critical.</p>
<p><strong>If This Happens:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trust terms control (can't be changed)</li>
<li>Court conservatorship may be needed for issues trust doesn't address</li>
<li>Another reason to keep trust updated while you can</li>
</ul>
<h3>If You Created an Irrevocable Trust</h3>
<p>By definition, irrevocable trusts generally can't be amended. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>California law provides some modification procedures under Probate Code Section 15404</li>
<li>Court petition may be possible in certain circumstances</li>
<li>Beneficiary consent sometimes allows changes</li>
</ul>
<h3>If Trust Is Contested</h3>
<p>If there's litigation about your trust's validity or your capacity, amendments during that period face intense scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Take Action: Protect Your Family with Updated Trust</h2>
<p>When did you last review your trust? If it's been more than 3-5 years, or if any of the 11 life events I discussed have occurred, your trust likely needs updates.</p>
<p>An outdated trust is worse than no trust at all—it creates a false sense of security while actually inviting family conflict, litigation, and outcomes you never intended.</p>

<h3>What to Bring to Your Consultation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your current trust document</li>
<li>Any prior amendments</li>
<li>List of current assets</li>
<li>Information about family changes since trust creation</li>
<li>Questions about whether your trust still works for your family</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Trust review consultations typically cost $300-$500 but may be credited toward amendment work.</p>
<p><strong>Return:</strong> Peace of mind that your family is protected and your wishes will be honored.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Can I amend my trust myself without an attorney?</h3>
<p>Legally, yes. California allows you to amend your own revocable trust. Practically, I strongly advise against it. DIY amendments frequently create ambiguities, conflicts, or don't accomplish what you intend—leading to litigation after you're gone.</p>
<h3>Do I need to notarize trust amendments?</h3>
<p>California doesn't require notarization for revocable living trust amendments. However, notarization provides proof of authenticity and is strongly recommended.</p>
<h3>How do I know if I should amend or restate my trust?</h3>
<p>General rule: One or two simple changes = amendment. Multiple complex changes or trust older than 15-20 years = consider restatement. Your attorney can advise based on your specific situation.</p>
<h3>What if my trust was created in another state?</h3>
<p>You can generally amend an out-of-state trust while living in California, but consult an attorney about whether California law changes should be incorporated.</p>
<h3>Can I amend my trust if my spouse has dementia?</h3>
<p>If you have a joint trust and your spouse lacks capacity, you may not be able to amend it without court involvement. However, you might be able to amend your separate trust if you have one.</p>
<h3>Will updating my trust trigger reassessment of my property taxes?</h3>
<p>No. Transferring property to or from your revocable living trust, or amending the trust, does not trigger California property tax reassessment under Proposition 13.</p>
