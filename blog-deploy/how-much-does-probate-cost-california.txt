7:T67e1,<p>"How much will probate cost?" This is the question I hear most frequently from families who have just lost a loved one. As a <a href="/locations/glendale.html">Glendale probate attorney</a>, I understand why cost is a primary concern—California has one of the most expensive probate systems in the United States, and the fees can be shocking to families who are unprepared.</p>
<p>The honest answer depends on your estate's total value, but here's what you need to know upfront: <strong>California probate typically costs between 4% and 8% of the total gross estate value</strong>, with a $1 million estate averaging $46,000 in total costs before extraordinary fees.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, I'll break down every cost component of California probate, provide the complete 2025 fee schedule, explain what factors increase expenses, and show you what you can do to minimize costs (or avoid probate entirely).</p>
<h2>California Statutory Probate Fees: The Foundation</h2>
<p>California Probate Code Section 10810 establishes mandatory "statutory fees" that both the probate attorney and the executor are entitled to receive, based on the gross value of the estate.</p>
<h3>Understanding "Gross Estate Value"</h3>
<p><strong>Critical point:</strong> Statutory fees are calculated on the <strong>gross</strong> value of estate assets, not the net value after debts.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Your mother's house is worth $800,000, but has a $400,000 mortgage. Statutory fees are calculated on $800,000, not the $400,000 equity.</p>
<p>This surprises many families. The estate might only have $400,000 in net value, but fees are based on $800,000—resulting in significantly higher costs than expected.</p>

<h3>The Statutory Fee Formula</h3>
<p>The fees are calculated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>For the first $100,000:</strong> 4%
<strong>For the next $100,000:</strong> 3%
<strong>For the next $800,000:</strong> 2%
<strong>For the next $9,000,000:</strong> 1%
<strong>For the next $15,000,000:</strong> 0.5%
<strong>For amounts over $25,000,000:</strong> A reasonable amount determined by the court</p>
<p><strong>Example calculation for $750,000 estate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First $100,000 × 4% = $4,000</li>
<li>Next $100,000 × 3% = $3,000</li>
<li>Next $650,000 × 2% = $13,000</li>
<li><strong>Total attorney fee: $20,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Total executor fee: $20,000</strong> (same calculation)</li>
<li><strong>Combined statutory fees: $40,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Both Attorney AND Executor Receive Full Fees</h3>
<p>Many families are shocked to learn that California law entitles both the attorney and the executor to the full statutory fee amount.</p>
<p><strong>For a $1 million estate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attorney receives: $23,000</li>
<li>Executor receives: $23,000</li>
<li>Total: $46,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> If the executor is also a beneficiary (such as an adult child), they often waive their executor fee to avoid taxation on that income. In this case, only the attorney fee of $23,000 applies.</p>
<h2>Beyond Statutory Fees: Additional Probate Costs</h2>
<p>Statutory fees are just the beginning. California probate involves numerous additional costs that many families don't anticipate.</p>
<h3>Court Filing Fees</h3>
<p><strong>Initial Petition for Probate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles County: $435</li>
<li>Other counties: $435-$500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Filings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Petition for sale of real property: $435</li>
<li>Petition for family allowance: $435</li>
<li>Petition for preliminary distribution: $435</li>
<li>Other motions and petitions: $60-$435 each</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical total court filing fees:</strong> $500-$1,500</p>
<h3>Publication Costs</h3>
<p>California Probate Code Section 8120 requires publication of the Notice of Petition to Administer Estate in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Typical publication costs:</strong> $300-$600</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Los Angeles County adjudicated newspapers charge more than smaller county newspapers.</p>
<h3>Probate Referee Fees</h3>
<p>California Probate Code Section 8960 requires appointment of a probate referee to appraise all estate assets (except cash accounts).</p>
<p><strong>Probate referee fee:</strong> 0.1% of the appraised value (one-tenth of one percent)</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real property worth $800,000</li>
<li>Personal property worth $50,000</li>
<li>Total appraised: $850,000</li>
<li>Referee fee: $850</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical probate referee fees:</strong> $500-$2,000</p>
<h3>Professional Appraisal Fees</h3>
<p>The probate referee may require independent professional appraisals for:</p>
<p><strong>Real estate appraisals:</strong> $400-$700 per property
<strong>Business valuations:</strong> $2,500-$10,000+
<strong>Personal property appraisals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jewelry, art, collectibles: $300-$1,000+</li>
<li>Household contents: $300-$500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical total appraisal costs:</strong> $500-$5,000+</p>
<h3>Bond Premiums</h3>
<p>If the will doesn't waive bond requirements, or if there is no will, the court may require the executor to post a bond to protect the estate from potential mismanagement.</p>
<p><strong>Bond premium:</strong> Approximately 0.5% to 1% of estate value annually</p>
<p><strong>Example for $500,000 estate:</strong> $2,500-$5,000</p>
<p><strong>Good news:</strong> Most properly drafted wills waive bond requirements, and family member executors can often avoid bonds even without a waiver.</p>
<h3>Accounting and Tax Preparation Fees</h3>
<p><strong>Estate tax return (Form 706):</strong> $2,500-$5,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Required for estates over $13.61 million (2024)</li>
<li>Due 9 months after death</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Estate income tax returns (Form 1041):</strong> $500-$1,500 per year</p>
<ul>
<li>Required if estate earns income during administration</li>
<li>Filed annually until estate closes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decedent's final personal income tax returns:</strong> $500-$1,500</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal and state returns</li>
<li>Due by April 15 following year of death</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Property tax assessment:</strong> $300-$500</p>
<ul>
<li>Supplemental assessment when title transfers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical total tax and accounting fees:</strong> $1,000-$8,000+</p>
<h3>Real Estate Commissions</h3>
<p>If estate real property must be sold during probate, real estate commissions apply.</p>
<p><strong>Typical commission:</strong> 5-6% of sale price (negotiable)</p>
<p><strong>Example for $800,000 house:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5% commission = $40,000</li>
<li>6% commission = $48,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Real estate commissions are NOT included in statutory fees and come "off the top" of the estate proceeds.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Attorney Fees</h3>
<p>California Probate Code Section 10811 allows attorneys to petition for "extraordinary fees" beyond statutory compensation for services including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will contests or litigation</li>
<li>Sale of real property requiring court confirmation</li>
<li>Tax disputes or audits</li>
<li>Carrying on decedent's business</li>
<li>Complex asset valuation issues</li>
<li>Out-of-state property (ancillary probate)</li>
<li>Contested creditor claims</li>
<li>Contested accountings</li>
<li>Trust litigation related to the estate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extraordinary fee billing:</strong> $350-$650 per hour, depending on attorney experience and location</p>
<p><strong>Real-world impact:</strong> Complex estates can incur $10,000-$100,000+ in extraordinary fees beyond the statutory amount.</p>
<h3>Maintenance and Operating Expenses</h3>
<p>During the 9-18 months of probate administration, the estate must pay ongoing costs:</p>
<p><strong>Real property expenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage payments: $2,000-$5,000/month</li>
<li>Property insurance: $1,200-$2,500/year</li>
<li>Property taxes: $5,000-$15,000/year</li>
<li>Utilities: $200-$400/month</li>
<li>Maintenance and repairs: $500-$5,000+</li>
<li>HOA dues: $200-$800/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business expenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If decedent owned a business, ongoing operational costs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage fees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For personal property, vehicles, etc.: $100-$300/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical ongoing expenses:</strong> $10,000-$50,000+ for a 12-18 month probate</p>

<h2>Factors That Increase Probate Costs</h2>
<p>Understanding what drives costs higher helps you anticipate expenses and potentially avoid them.</p>
<h3>1. Real Estate Sales</h3>
<p>Selling property during probate adds substantial costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real estate commissions (5-6% of sale price)</li>
<li>Court confirmation hearings ($435 filing + attorney time)</li>
<li>Overbidding procedures (if required)</li>
<li>Extended property maintenance during marketing period</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $40,000-$100,000+ depending on property value</p>
<h3>2. Will Contests and Litigation</h3>
<p>Contested probate cases can multiply costs dramatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery (depositions, document requests)</li>
<li>Expert witnesses (handwriting, medical, financial)</li>
<li>Motions and court hearings</li>
<li>Potential trial</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $50,000-$250,000+ in extraordinary attorney fees</p>
<h3>3. Out-of-State Property</h3>
<p>Real estate located outside California requires "ancillary probate" in that state.</p>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $5,000-$25,000+ per state (essentially running two probates)</p>
<h3>4. Business Interests</h3>
<p>Active businesses require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional valuation</li>
<li>Ongoing management decisions</li>
<li>Potential sale of business</li>
<li>Employee and vendor issues</li>
<li>Tax complications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $10,000-$50,000+ in additional fees</p>
<h3>5. Estate Tax Returns</h3>
<p>Estates exceeding the federal estate tax exemption ($13.61 million in 2024) must file Form 706.</p>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $2,500-$8,000 in preparation fees, plus potential IRS audit costs</p>
<h3>6. Creditor Disputes</h3>
<p>When creditor claims are contested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objections to claims must be filed</li>
<li>Court hearings required</li>
<li>Potential litigation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $2,000-$15,000 per disputed claim</p>
<h3>7. Family Disputes</h3>
<p>Even without formal will contests, family disagreements increase costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disputes over asset distributions</li>
<li>Challenges to executor's actions</li>
<li>Disagreements about property sales</li>
<li>Conflicts over personal property division</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost impact:</strong> $5,000-$50,000+ in additional attorney time</p>
<h2>How to Minimize Probate Costs</h2>
<p>While you cannot eliminate statutory fees once probate begins, you can minimize additional expenses.</p>
<h3>Strategy #1: Request Independent Administration Authority</h3>
<p><strong>California Probate Code Sections 10400-10592</strong></p>
<p>The Independent Administration of Estates Act (IAEA) allows executors to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell real property without court confirmation (with certain exceptions)</li>
<li>Distribute assets without court approval</li>
<li>Settle claims without hearings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $2,000-$8,000 in court filing fees and attorney time</p>
<h3>Strategy #2: Hire a Flat-Fee Probate Attorney</h3>
<p>Some California probate attorneys offer flat-fee arrangements for straightforward estates, rather than statutory fees.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An attorney might accept $15,000 for handling a $1 million estate (instead of the $23,000 statutory fee).</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Ensure the flat fee covers all standard services, not just petition preparation.</p>
<h3>Strategy #3: Executor Waives Compensation</h3>
<p>If the executor is a primary beneficiary, they should consider waiving their executor fee. Here's why:</p>
<p><strong>Executor fees are taxable income</strong> (subject to federal and state income tax)
<strong>Inheritances are tax-free</strong> to beneficiaries</p>
<p><strong>Example for $1M estate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Executor fee: $23,000</li>
<li>Income taxes (35% bracket): $8,050</li>
<li>Net benefit to executor: $14,950</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But:</strong> This $23,000 comes out of the estate, reducing the total inheritance pool. If the executor is a 50% beneficiary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost to executor as beneficiary: $11,500 (50% of $23,000)</li>
<li>Net benefit after taxes: $14,950 - $11,500 = $3,450</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Unless the executor is a minor beneficiary, waiving the fee usually makes financial sense.</p>
<h3>Strategy #4: Settle Family Disputes Out of Court</h3>
<p>Mediation costs $3,000-$10,000 and can resolve disputes that would otherwise cost $50,000-$100,000 in litigation.</p>
<h3>Strategy #5: Maintain Property Efficiently</h3>
<p>Minimize ongoing property expenses by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renting estate property if appropriate</li>
<li>Selling property quickly (once you have court authority)</li>
<li>Canceling unnecessary services</li>
<li>Shopping insurance for better rates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $5,000-$20,000 over the probate period</p>
<h3>Strategy #6: Organize Estate Documents</h3>
<p>Being organized reduces attorney time spent tracking down information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile complete asset lists</li>
<li>Gather financial statements</li>
<li>Identify all creditors</li>
<li>Maintain organized records</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Savings:</strong> $1,000-$3,000 in attorney time</p>
<h2>Probate Costs vs. Trust Administration Costs</h2>
<p>The most effective way to minimize probate costs is to avoid probate entirely through proper estate planning.</p>
<h3>Probate Costs for $1M Estate</h3>
<p><strong>Statutory fees:</strong> $46,000 (attorney + executor)
<strong>Additional costs:</strong> $15,000-$35,000
<strong>Total:</strong> $61,000-$81,000
<strong>Time:</strong> 12-18 months</p>
<h3>Trust Administration Costs for $1M Estate</h3>
<p><strong>Attorney fees:</strong> $4,000-$8,000
<strong>Accounting fees:</strong> $1,000-$2,000
<strong>Filing fees:</strong> $0 (no court involvement)
<strong>Total:</strong> $5,000-$10,000
<strong>Time:</strong> 4-8 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Savings by using a trust: $51,000-$71,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cost to create living trust: $2,500-$5,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Net savings: $46,000-$66,000</strong></p>
<p>The math is compelling. Even for modest estates, the cost of creating a living trust is recovered many times over by avoiding probate.</p>
<h2>When Low-Cost Probate Alternatives Are Available</h2>
<p>California provides simplified procedures for small estates that cost significantly less than full probate.</p>
<h3>Small Estate Affidavit (Estates Under $184,500)</h3>
<p><strong>California Probate Code Section 13100</strong></p>
<p>If the estate's total value is under $184,500 (excluding real property), heirs can use a simple affidavit procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No court filing required</li>
<li>No attorney fees required (though consultation recommended)</li>
<li>Financial institutions may charge processing fees</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $500-$1,500 (mostly for attorney consultation)</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 40 days minimum after death</p>
<h3>Spousal Property Petition (Community Property to Surviving Spouse)</h3>
<p><strong>California Probate Code Section 13500</strong></p>
<p>Surviving spouses can use a simplified petition to transfer community property.</p>
<p><strong>Costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Court filing fee: $435</li>
<li>Attorney fee: $1,500-$3,500 (not statutory)</li>
<li>Publication: $300-$500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $2,500-$5,000</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 60-90 days</p>
<h3>Transfer-on-Death (TOD) Deed</h3>
<p>Assets that pass by beneficiary designation or TOD deed avoid probate entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Costs:</strong> $0 (assets pass directly to beneficiaries)</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Probate Costs</h2>
<h3>Can we negotiate the statutory fees?</h3>
<p>No. California Probate Code Section 10810 sets statutory fees, and courts are not authorized to reduce them absent extraordinary circumstances. However, attorneys can agree to accept less than the statutory amount (flat fee arrangements).</p>
<h3>Who pays the probate costs?</h3>
<p>Probate costs are paid from the estate assets before distribution to beneficiaries. If the estate lacks sufficient funds, real property or other assets must be sold to cover costs.</p>
<h3>Are probate costs tax deductible?</h3>
<p>Yes, but only on the estate's income tax return (Form 1041), not on individual beneficiaries' returns. Executor fees are taxable income to the executor.</p>
<h3>What if the estate can't afford probate costs?</h3>
<p>If the estate truly lacks sufficient assets, the executor may be able to use simplified small estate procedures, or in rare cases, the court may reduce fees. However, this is extremely difficult to prove since selling estate assets usually generates sufficient funds.</p>
<h3>Does the executor pay probate costs personally?</h3>
<p>No. The executor is never personally responsible for probate costs. All costs are paid from estate assets. If the executor improperly uses personal funds, they should be reimbursed by the estate.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line: Plan Ahead to Save Your Family Money</h2>
<p>California probate is expensive—there's no way around that fact. For a typical California estate valued at $1 million, your family will pay approximately $60,000-$80,000 in probate costs, and wait 12-18 months to receive their inheritance.</p>
<p>The same estate administered through a properly funded living trust costs $5,000-$10,000 and is completed in 4-8 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>The math is simple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost to create living trust: $3,500</li>
<li>Savings by avoiding probate: $55,000-$75,000</li>
<li>Net benefit: $51,500-$71,500</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for modest estates, the savings are substantial and the benefits extend beyond cost savings to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy (trust administration is not public record)</li>
<li>Speed (weeks instead of months)</li>
<li>Incapacity planning (no conservatorship needed)</li>
<li>Control over distributions</li>
<li>Asset protection for beneficiaries</li>
</ul>
