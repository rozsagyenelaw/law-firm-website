7:T5b94,<p>"Do I need to go through probate for my mother's house? What about her bank accounts?"</p>
<p>As a Glendale probate attorney, this is one of the most common questions I hear from families dealing with a loved one's death. The answer depends entirely on how assets were titled and whether beneficiaries were designated.</p>
<p>Understanding which assets go through probate—and which don't—is critical for both families handling an estate and anyone doing estate planning to help their family avoid probate.</p>
<p>This comprehensive guide explains exactly which assets require California probate, which assets pass outside probate, the $184,500 threshold that matters, and proven strategies to keep assets out of probate entirely.</p>
<h2>What Does "Going Through Probate" Mean?</h2>
<p><strong>Probate</strong> is the court-supervised legal process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validating a will (if one exists)</li>
<li>Appointing an executor or administrator</li>
<li>Identifying and inventorying assets</li>
<li>Paying debts and taxes</li>
<li>Distributing remaining assets to beneficiaries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California probate typically takes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 12-18 months minimum</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $20,000-$100,000+ in fees</li>
<li><strong>Public record:</strong> Court files are accessible to anyone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assets that "go through probate"</strong> must be transferred through this formal court process.</p>
<p><strong>Assets that "pass outside probate"</strong> transfer directly to beneficiaries without court involvement.</p>
<h2>The $184,500 Threshold</h2>
<p><strong>California Probate Code Section 13100</strong></p>
<p><strong>If total probate assets are worth $184,500 or less</strong>, heirs can use simplified procedures instead of formal probate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small estate affidavit</li>
<li>Affidavit for Real Property (if real estate under $61,500)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If probate assets exceed $184,500</strong>, formal probate is required.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This threshold is for probate assets only. Non-probate assets don't count toward this limit.</p>
<h2>Assets That GO THROUGH Probate</h2>
<h3>1. Real Estate in Deceased's Name Alone</h3>
<p><strong>Probate required if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deed shows decedent as sole owner</li>
<li>Titled as "tenants in common" (not joint tenancy)</li>
<li>No transfer-on-death deed</li>
<li>Not held in trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>House owned solely by decedent</li>
<li>Vacant land in decedent's name</li>
<li>Rental property without beneficiary designation</li>
<li>Timeshare in individual name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even if will says "leave house to daughter,"</strong> probate is required to transfer title.</p>
<h3>2. Bank Accounts in Sole Name (No Beneficiary)</h3>
<p><strong>Probate required if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account in decedent's name only</li>
<li>No "payable on death" (POD) beneficiary</li>
<li>Not joint account with right of survivorship</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Checking account: "John Smith"</li>
<li>Savings account without POD designation</li>
<li>Certificates of deposit (CDs) without beneficiary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The bank cannot release funds without probate.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Investment Accounts Without Transfer-on-Death</h3>
<p><strong>Probate required if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brokerage account in sole name</li>
<li>No "transfer on death" (TOD) beneficiary</li>
<li>Individual account (not joint)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>E*TRADE account: "Mary Johnson"</li>
<li>Vanguard account without TOD</li>
<li>Individual stock certificates</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Vehicles in Decedent's Name Only</h3>
<p><strong>Generally probate required</strong> unless using simplified DMV procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> California allows simplified transfer for vehicles if estate qualifies for small estate procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Probate needed for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cars, trucks, motorcycles</li>
<li>Boats</li>
<li>RVs</li>
<li>Aircraft</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Without additional owners or TOD beneficiary.</strong></p>
<h3>5. Business Interests Without Succession Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Probate required for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sole proprietorships</li>
<li>Partnership interests without buy-sell agreement</li>
<li>LLC membership interests in individual name</li>
<li>Corporate stock in individual name</li>
<li>Professional practices</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Personal Property in Deceased's Name</h3>
<p><strong>Probate may be required for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jewelry</li>
<li>Art and collectibles</li>
<li>Furniture and household items</li>
<li>Valuable personal effects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical reality:</strong> Small personal items often distributed informally, but technically should go through probate if estate exceeds $184,500.</p>
<h3>7. Money Owed to Decedent</h3>
<p><strong>Probate required to collect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promissory notes payable to decedent</li>
<li>Lawsuit settlements</li>
<li>Unpaid wages or commissions</li>
<li>Security deposits</li>
<li>Tax refunds (sometimes)</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
<p><strong>Probate required for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Copyrights</li>
<li>Patents</li>
<li>Royalty rights</li>
<li>Licensing agreements</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Cryptocurrency in Individual Wallets</h3>
<p><strong>Probate likely required</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto held in personal wallet (not exchange)</li>
<li>No beneficiary designation</li>
<li>Access requires private keys</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical challenge:</strong> Locating and accessing crypto can be difficult.</p>
<h2>Assets That DO NOT Go Through Probate</h2>
<h3>1. Joint Tenancy Property (With Right of Survivorship)</h3>
<p><strong>Passes automatically to surviving joint tenant(s).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deed or title must specify "joint tenancy"</li>
<li>Must say "with right of survivorship"</li>
<li>Surviving owner inherits automatically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>House: "John Smith and Mary Smith, as joint tenants"</li>
<li>Bank account: "Joint tenants with right of survivorship"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Record death certificate with county recorder</li>
<li>Property passes to survivor immediately</li>
<li>No probate required</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If all joint tenants die, probate is required.</p>
<h3>2. Community Property with Right of Survivorship</h3>
<p><strong>California allows this special title form.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passes automatically to surviving spouse</strong> without probate.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Must be married or registered domestic partners</li>
<li>Deed must say "community property with right of survivorship"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantage over regular community property:</strong> Regular community property may require spousal property petition; this form passes automatically.</p>
<h3>3. Assets in Living Trust</h3>
<p><strong>Trust assets avoid probate entirely.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If property titled:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"John Smith, Trustee of the Smith Family Trust"</li>
<li>Assets held in trust name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At death:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Successor trustee takes over</li>
<li>Distributes assets per trust terms</li>
<li>No court involvement (trust administration is private)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most effective probate avoidance strategy.</strong></p>
<h3>4. Payable-on-Death (POD) Bank Accounts</h3>
<p><strong>Bank accounts with POD beneficiaries pass directly to beneficiaries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Account owner designates beneficiary on bank form</li>
<li>Account remains in owner's control during life</li>
<li>At death, beneficiary presents death certificate to bank</li>
<li>Bank transfers funds directly to beneficiary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Also called:</strong> Totten trust, in trust for (ITF) account</p>
<h3>5. Transfer-on-Death (TOD) Investment Accounts</h3>
<p><strong>Brokerage accounts with TOD beneficiaries pass outside probate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Owner completes TOD registration form</li>
<li>Beneficiary has no rights until owner's death</li>
<li>At death, beneficiary provides death certificate</li>
<li>Assets transfer directly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California law</strong> allows TOD registration for stocks, bonds, and brokerage accounts.</p>
<h3>6. Retirement Accounts with Beneficiary Designations</h3>
<p><strong>Pass directly to named beneficiaries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>401(k) plans</strong> → To designated beneficiary</li>
<li><strong>IRA accounts</strong> → To designated beneficiary</li>
<li><strong>403(b) plans</strong> → To designated beneficiary</li>
<li><strong>Pension benefits</strong> → Per plan rules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical:</strong> Beneficiary designation controls, even if will says something different.</p>
<p><strong>Common problem:</strong> Outdated beneficiary designations (ex-spouse still listed).</p>
<h3>7. Life Insurance Policies with Named Beneficiaries</h3>
<p><strong>Death benefits pass directly to beneficiaries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beneficiary files claim with insurance company</li>
<li>Provides death certificate</li>
<li>Receives proceeds directly</li>
<li>No probate required</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> If estate is named beneficiary, proceeds go through probate.</p>
<h3>8. Transfer-on-Death Deeds for Real Estate</h3>
<p><strong>California allows TOD deeds</strong> (California Probate Code Section 5600).</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Owner records revocable TOD deed</li>
<li>Property stays in owner's control during life</li>
<li>Owner can revoke anytime</li>
<li>At death, property passes to named beneficiary</li>
<li>Beneficiary records death certificate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoids probate</li>
<li>Retains full control during life</li>
<li>Can be changed anytime</li>
<li>Lower cost than trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only for owner-occupied residential property (1-4 units)</li>
<li>Can't use for rental or commercial property</li>
<li>Can trigger property tax reassessment</li>
<li>Limited protection compared to trust</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Property Held in Survivorship Forms</h3>
<p><strong>Special title forms that avoid probate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenancy by the entirety</strong> (limited California recognition)</li>
<li><strong>Joint tenancy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Community property with right of survivorship</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Assets With Contractual Beneficiaries</h3>
<p><strong>Any asset with valid beneficiary designation passes outside probate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annuities</li>
<li>Certain bonds (with TOD)</li>
<li>Credit union accounts with POD</li>
<li>Some club memberships with transfer rights</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Situations and Grey Areas</h2>
<h3>Community Property (Regular, Without Right of Survivorship)</h3>
<p><strong>California community property without WROS designation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does it require probate?</strong> Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</p>
<p><strong>Options for surviving spouse:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spousal Property Petition</strong> (simplified procedure)</li>
<li><strong>Full probate</strong> (if other issues exist)</li>
<li><strong>Small estate procedures</strong> (if under threshold)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not automatic transfer</strong> like joint tenancy.</p>
<h3>Jointly Owned Property Without "Right of Survivorship"</h3>
<p><strong>"Tenants in common" ownership:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Probate required</strong> for deceased's share.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Property owned 50/50 as tenants in common.</p>
<ul>
<li>One owner dies</li>
<li>Deceased's 50% goes through probate</li>
<li>Surviving owner keeps their 50%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tenancy in common is default</strong> in California unless deed specifies joint tenancy.</p>
<h3>Property in Decedent's Trust Not Properly Funded</h3>
<p><strong>If trust exists but property wasn't transferred to it:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Probate required</strong> because property is still in individual name.</p>
<p><strong>Common issue:</strong> Trust created but real estate never deeded to trust.</p>
<p><strong>Solution during life:</strong> Pour-over will (sends probate assets to trust after probate).</p>
<h3>Property Outside California</h3>
<p><strong>California probate only covers California property.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Out-of-state real estate requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ancillary probate in that state, OR</li>
<li>Avoid by holding in trust</li>
</ul>
<h3>Property Acquired After Trust Funded</h3>
<p><strong>Property acquired after trust created:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requires probate unless:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically transferred to trust</li>
<li>Has beneficiary designation</li>
<li>Held in joint tenancy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retirement Accounts With No Beneficiary</h3>
<p><strong>If retirement account has NO designated beneficiary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passes to estate → Requires probate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also triggers worst tax consequences</strong> (must be distributed quickly, losing tax deferral).</p>
<h3>Vehicles: Special California Rules</h3>
<p><strong>California allows simplified transfer</strong> for vehicles if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estate qualifies for small estate procedures (under $184,500)</li>
<li>Vehicle value under certain threshold</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DMV Form:</strong> REG 5 (Affidavit for Transfer Without Probate)</p>
<p><strong>If estate exceeds threshold:</strong> Vehicle technically requires probate, though often transferred informally.</p>
<h2>How to Determine If Probate Is Required</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Make Complete Asset List</h3>
<p><strong>List every asset decedent owned:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Asset</th>
<th>Title/Ownership</th>
<th>Estimated Value</th>
<th>Beneficiary?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>House</td>
<td>Individual name</td>
<td>$800,000</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bank account</td>
<td>POD to daughter</td>
<td>$50,000</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IRA</td>
<td>TOD to son</td>
<td>$200,000</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Car</td>
<td>Individual</td>
<td>$25,000</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Step 2: Identify Non-Probate Assets</h3>
<p><strong>Remove from probate calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joint tenancy property</li>
<li>Assets with beneficiaries</li>
<li>Trust assets</li>
<li>All non-probate transfers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Calculate Total Probate Assets</h3>
<p><strong>Add up remaining assets in individual name:</strong></p>
<p>From example above:</p>
<ul>
<li>House: $800,000 (no beneficiary)</li>
<li>Car: $25,000 (no beneficiary)</li>
<li><strong>Total probate assets: $825,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Exceeds $184,500 → Formal probate required</p>
<h3>Step 4: Consider Simplified Procedures</h3>
<p><strong>If total is $184,500 or less:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small estate affidavit</li>
<li>Simplified procedures</li>
<li>No formal probate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategies to Avoid Probate</h2>
<h3>Strategy #1: Create Living Trust</h3>
<p><strong>Most comprehensive solution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer all assets to trust</li>
<li>You remain trustee during life</li>
<li>Successor trustee takes over at death</li>
<li>Assets distributed per trust terms</li>
<li>No probate required</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> California homeowners, anyone with assets over $200K</p>
<h3>Strategy #2: Add Transfer-on-Death Designations</h3>
<p><strong>For specific assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bank accounts → Add POD beneficiary</li>
<li>Investment accounts → Add TOD beneficiary</li>
<li>Consider TOD deed for real estate (if eligible)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Simple, low-cost, retains full control</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Less comprehensive than trust, no incapacity planning</p>
<h3>Strategy #3: Convert to Joint Tenancy</h3>
<p><strong>Add joint owner with right of survivorship.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joint owner has immediate rights to property</li>
<li>Can't be undone without joint owner's consent</li>
<li>May have gift tax implications</li>
<li>Property becomes joint owner's community property if they're married</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use carefully and with legal advice.</strong></p>
<h3>Strategy #4: Life Estate Deeds</h3>
<p><strong>Transfer property but retain life estate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You live in/use property during life</li>
<li>Property passes to remainder beneficiary at death</li>
<li>Avoids probate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can't sell easily without remainder beneficiary's consent</li>
<li>Property tax issues</li>
<li>Less flexible than trust</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy #5: Beneficiary Designations on All Eligible Assets</h3>
<p><strong>Maximum use of beneficiary designations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Life insurance</li>
<li>Retirement accounts</li>
<li>Bank accounts (POD)</li>
<li>Investment accounts (TOD)</li>
<li>Any asset allowing beneficiary designation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Keep beneficiaries updated!</p>
<h3>Strategy #6: Gift Assets During Life</h3>
<p><strong>Transfer property before death:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No longer in your estate at death</li>
<li>No probate for gifted assets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gift tax rules</li>
<li>Loss of control</li>
<li>Medicaid lookback (if relevant)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not usually recommended as primary strategy.</strong></p>
<h3>Strategy #7: Small Estate Planning</h3>
<p><strong>If estate under $184,500:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May not need extensive planning</li>
<li>Small estate procedures available</li>
<li>Consider POD/TOD for convenience</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Probate Avoidance Mistakes</h2>
<h3>Mistake #1: Failing to Fund Trust</h3>
<p><strong>Creating trust but not transferring assets</strong> defeats the purpose.</p>
<p><strong>All assets must be retitled</strong> to trust to avoid probate.</p>
<h3>Mistake #2: Outdated Beneficiary Designations</h3>
<p><strong>Most common issue I see:</strong></p>
<p>Ex-spouse still listed on 401(k) 10 years after divorce.</p>
<p><strong>Beneficiary designations override will.</strong></p>
<h3>Mistake #3: Assuming Joint Accounts Avoid Probate for Everyone</h3>
<p><strong>Adding child as joint owner on account:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Child has immediate access</li>
<li>Funds become child's if you don't spend them</li>
<li>Other children may not receive fair share</li>
<li>May cause gift tax issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Better:</strong> POD designation</p>
<h3>Mistake #4: No Plan for Out-of-State Property</h3>
<p><strong>Vacation home in another state requires ancillary probate</strong> unless held in trust or joint tenancy.</p>
<h3>Mistake #5: DIY Estate Planning Without Full Understanding</h3>
<p><strong>Using online forms without legal advice risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid documents</li>
<li>Incorrect titling</li>
<li>Unintended tax consequences</li>
<li>Assets not properly covered</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What if someone dies with both probate and non-probate assets?</h3>
<p>Non-probate assets transfer directly to beneficiaries. Probate assets go through probate. This is common.</p>
<h3>Do all assets have to go through probate if one asset requires it?</h3>
<p>No. Only assets in individual name without beneficiaries require probate. Other assets transfer outside probate.</p>
<h3>How do I know how property is titled?</h3>
<p>Check deed (for real estate), account statements, title documents. County recorder has property records. Banks can provide account registration.</p>
<h3>Can I avoid probate with just a will?</h3>
<p>No. A will does NOT avoid probate. Wills must be probated. Only trusts and beneficiary designations avoid probate.</p>
<h3>What about property in an LLC?</h3>
<p>If LLC membership interest is in your individual name, it goes through probate (unless in trust or other arrangement).</p>
<h3>Do retirement accounts ever go through probate?</h3>
<p>Only if estate is named beneficiary or no beneficiary designated. Otherwise they pass directly to beneficiaries.</p>
<h3>What happens if property is titled incorrectly?</h3>
<p>May require probate even if you intended to avoid it. This is why proper titling is critical.</p>
