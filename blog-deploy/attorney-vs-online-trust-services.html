<h2>The Core Problem with All Online Trust Services</h2>
<p>Regardless of which service you choose, they all share fundamental limitations:</p>
<h3>1. No Personalized Legal Advice</h3>
<p>Every online service explicitly disclaims that they are not law firms and cannot provide legal advice. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one analyzes whether a living trust is even the right solution for you</li>
<li>No one identifies planning opportunities you might be missing</li>
<li>No one spots potential problems with your intended plan</li>
<li>No one explains the implications of your choices</li>
</ul>
<p>You're essentially self-diagnosing a legal situation using a questionnaire designed for the average person—not for your specific circumstances.</p>
<h3>2. Template-Based Documents</h3>
<p>All these services use templates modified by your questionnaire answers. The problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Templates can't anticipate every situation</li>
<li>California has unique requirements that generic templates may miss</li>
<li>Complex family situations often require customized language</li>
<li>Important provisions may be omitted or inadequate</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. The Funding Gap</h3>
<p>Creating a trust document is only half the job. The trust must be "funded"—meaning assets must be properly transferred into it. Online services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide general instructions but don't ensure follow-through</li>
<li>Don't handle your deed transfer (or charge extra)</li>
<li>Don't review your beneficiary designations</li>
<li>Don't verify your trust will actually avoid probate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The sobering reality:</strong> Studies suggest 70% or more of DIY trusts are improperly funded. When these people die, their families face probate anyway—exactly what the trust was supposed to prevent.</p>
<h3>4. No Ongoing Relationship</h3>
<p>Estate plans need updates as life changes and laws evolve. Online services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't proactively reach out when laws change</li>
<li>Charge for updates and amendments</li>
<li>Have no one who knows your situation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Online Trust Services Work For</h2>
<p>To be fair, online services can work for some people. You might be a good candidate if:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very simple situation:</strong> Single, no children, renting (no real estate), minimal assets</li>
<li><strong>Standard distribution:</strong> Everything to spouse, then children equally</li>
<li><strong>No complexity:</strong> No blended family, no estranged relatives, no special needs beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong>Technologically comfortable:</strong> You can navigate online forms confidently</li>
<li><strong>Self-directed:</strong> You're willing to research and understand what you're creating</li>
<li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> You'll actually complete the funding process</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even if all these apply, our $575 package provides much more value at a comparable price.</p>
<h2>Who Should NOT Use Online Trust Services</h2>
<p>Work with an attorney if any of these apply:</p>
<h3>California Real Estate Owners</h3>
<p>If you own a home in California, you need professional help. The deed transfer must be done correctly, Prop 19 implications need consideration, and title issues can arise from improper transfers. Online services either don't handle this or do it as an afterthought.</p>
<h3>Parents with Minor Children</h3>
<p>Proper guardian nominations, age-appropriate distribution provisions, and trust protections for minors require thoughtful planning that questionnaires can't provide.</p>
<h3>Blended Families</h3>
<p>Second marriages, stepchildren, and children from different relationships require careful balancing. Getting this wrong can lead to litigation.</p>
<h3>Business Owners</h3>
<p>Business succession planning is complex. Your business interests need proper treatment that goes beyond standard templates.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Investors</h3>
<p>Multiple properties, LLCs, and investment structures require sophisticated planning.</p>
<h3>High Net Worth Individuals</h3>
<p>If your estate exceeds $500,000, the stakes are too high for template documents.</p>
<h3>Special Needs Situations</h3>
<p>A beneficiary receiving government benefits requires a special needs trust—doing this wrong can be catastrophic.</p>
<h3>Estate Tax Concerns</h3>
<p>If your estate might owe estate taxes (currently $13.61 million federal exemption, but state rules vary), you need professional tax planning.</p>
<h3>Potential Family Disputes</h3>
<p>If there's any chance someone might challenge your estate plan, you need ironclad documents prepared by an attorney.</p>
<h2>Real Problems I've Seen from Online Trust Services</h2>
<p>From my practice, here are actual situations where online trusts failed:</p>
<h3>The Unfunded Nightmare</h3>
<p>A couple used an online service for their trust, never transferred their home, and died in an accident. Their children had to go through full probate—18 months and $45,000 in fees. The $599 trust was useless.</p>
<h3>The Blended Family Disaster</h3>
<p>A man with children from his first marriage used an online trust after his second marriage. The generic language gave his second wife too much control. When he died, she changed everything, and his children inherited nothing.</p>
<h3>The Missing Pieces</h3>
<p>A woman's online trust had no provisions for what happened if her primary beneficiary died before her. When her daughter predeceased her, the trust had a gap that required court interpretation.</p>
<h3>The Tax Trap</h3>
<p>A couple with a $3 million estate used an online trust without understanding the estate tax implications. Their children ended up paying estate taxes that could have been avoided with proper planning.</p>
<h2>The Attorney Advantage</h2>
<p>When you work with our firm, here's what you actually get:</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Consultation</h3>
<p>We meet to discuss your specific situation, family dynamics, goals, and concerns. I ask questions you might not think of and identify planning opportunities.</p>
<h3>Customized Documents</h3>
<p>Your trust is drafted for your specific situation—not generated from a template. Every provision is intentional.</p>
<h3>Complete Funding</h3>
<p>We prepare the deed to transfer your home and guide you through funding all assets. Your trust will actually work.</p>
<h3>All Essential Documents</h3>
<p>Living trust, pour-over will, financial power of attorney, healthcare power of attorney, HIPAA authorization—everything you need, properly executed.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I explain how everything works so you understand your own estate plan.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Relationship</h3>
<p>You have an attorney who knows your family and can help when questions arise or life changes.</p>
<h2>Cost Comparison: The Real Math</h2>
<p>Let's do the honest math for a California homeowner:</p>
<h3>Online Service (Trust &#x26; Will Example)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Living trust package: $599</li>
<li>Deed transfer add-on: $149</li>
<li>Total: $748</li>
<li>What you don't get: personalized advice, funding verification, ongoing relationship</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Firm</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete package (married couple): $675</li>
<li>Includes: personalized advice, deed transfer, funding guidance, all documents, consultation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The online service costs more and provides less.</strong></p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Which online trust service is best for California?</h3>
<p>For very simple situations, Trust &#x26; Will is generally the most user-friendly option. However, none of the online services can provide personalized legal advice, ensure proper trust funding, or address complex California-specific issues. For California homeowners or anyone with moderate complexity, working with an affordable attorney provides better protection.</p>
<h3>What's the difference between Trust &#x26; Will, Rocket Lawyer, and Nolo?</h3>
<p>Trust &#x26; Will ($599) focuses on estate planning with a modern interface but limited customization. Rocket Lawyer ($39.99/month subscription) offers various legal documents but estate planning isn't their specialty. Nolo ($199 for software) is more DIY-oriented, providing forms and guidance but requiring more self-directed work. None provide personalized legal advice or ensure proper trust funding.</p>
<h3>Can I transfer my California home into a trust using online services?</h3>
<p>Most online services either don't include deed transfers or charge extra ($100-200+). More importantly, they can't ensure the deed is prepared correctly for California's specific requirements, Prop 19 implications, or title insurance considerations. Improperly prepared deeds can cause title issues, property tax reassessment, or failure to avoid probate. An attorney ensures this critical step is done correctly.</p>
<h3>Are online trust services legitimate?</h3>
<p>Yes, they're legitimate companies that provide legal document preparation. However, they're not law firms and cannot provide legal advice. The documents they generate are templates modified by your questionnaire answers. For very simple situations, the documents can work. The problems arise when situations are more complex than users realize, or when trusts aren't properly funded after creation.</p>
<h3>How much does an estate planning attorney cost compared to online services?</h3>
<p>Online services range from $199-$599+ for basic trusts, plus extras for deed preparation and other add-ons. Attorneys in California typically charge $1,500-$5,000+ for living trust packages. However, our firm offers complete living trust packages starting at $575 (single) and $675 (couples), including deed transfer, personalized advice, and all essential documents—comparable to online services but with professional guidance.</p>
<h2>Making Your Decision</h2>
<p>Here's my honest recommendation:</p>
<p><strong>If you're a California homeowner, have children, own a business, or have any complexity in your family or finances—work with an attorney.</strong> The cost is comparable to online services when you factor in everything you actually need, and the protection is vastly superior.</p>
<p>Our $575-$675 packages provide everything you need, with personalized attention and professional expertise that online services simply cannot match.</p>

However, none of the online services can provide personalized legal advice, ensure proper trust funding, or address complex California-specific issues. For California homeowners or anyone with moderate complexity, working with an affordable attorney provides better protection."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What's the difference between Trust & Will, Rocket Lawyer, and Nolo?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Trust & Will ($599) focuses on estate planning with a modern interface but limited customization. Rocket Lawyer ($39.99/month subscription) offers various legal documents but estate planning isn't their specialty. Nolo ($199 for software) is more DIY-oriented, providing forms and guidance but requiring more self-directed work. None provide personalized legal advice or ensure proper trust funding."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I transfer my California home into a trust using online services?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most online services either don't include deed transfers or charge extra ($100-200+). More importantly, they can't ensure the deed is prepared correctly for California's specific requirements, Prop 19 implications, or title insurance considerations. Improperly prepared deeds can cause title issues, property tax reassessment, or failure to avoid probate. An attorney ensures this critical step is done correctly."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are online trust services legitimate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, they're legitimate companies that provide legal document preparation. However, they're not law firms and cannot provide legal advice. The documents they generate are templates modified by your questionnaire answers. For very simple situations, the documents can work. The problems arise when situations are more complex than users realize, or when trusts aren't properly funded after creation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does an estate planning attorney cost compared to online services?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Online services range from $199-$599+ for basic trusts, plus extras for deed preparation and other add-ons. Attorneys in California typically charge $1,500-$5,000+ for living trust packages. However, our firm offers complete living trust packages starting at $575 (single) and $675 (couples), including deed transfer, personalized advice, and all essential documents—comparable to online services but with professional guidance."}}]}</script></div></main><footer class="bg-primary-blue text-white mt-20 no-print"><div class="container-custom py-12"><div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8"><div><h3 class="font-playfair text-2xl mb-4">Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene</h3><p class="text-white/80 mb-4">Over 25 years of experience serving Los Angeles County families with comprehensive estate planning and trust services.</p></div><div><h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4 text-accent-gold">Contact</h4><div class="space-y-2 text-white/80"><p>450 N Brand Blvd Ste 600</p><p>Glendale, CA 91203</p><p class="mt-4"><a href="tel:8182916217" class="text-accent-gold hover:underline">(818) 291-6217</a></p></div></div><div><h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4 text-accent-gold">Practice Areas</h4><ul class="space-y-2 text-white/80"><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/living-trusts.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Living Trusts</a></li><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/probate.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Probate</a></li><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/trust-administration.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Trust Administration</a></li><li><a href="https://livingtrust-attorneys.com/conservatorship.html" class="hover:text-accent-gold transition-colors">Conservatorship</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="border-t border-white/10 mt-8 pt-8 text-center text-white/70 text-sm"><p>© <!-- -->2025<!-- --> Law Offices of Rozsa Gyene.

However, none of the online services can provide personalized legal advice, ensure proper trust funding, or address complex California-specific issues.

Rocket Lawyer ($39.99/month subscription) offers various legal documents but estate planning isn't their specialty. Nolo ($199 for software) is more DIY-oriented, providing forms and guidance but requiring more self-directed work. None provide personalized legal advice or ensure proper trust funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCan I transfer my California home into a trust using online services?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost online services either don't include deed transfers or charge extra ($100-200+). More importantly, they can't ensure the deed is prepared correctly for California's specific requirements, Prop 19 implications, or title insurance considerations.

However, they're not law firms and cannot provide legal advice. The documents they generate are templates modified by your questionnaire answers. For very simple situations, the documents can work.
