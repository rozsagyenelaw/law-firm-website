                <p>Trust administration in Burbank begins with the successor trustee serving the <strong>16061.7 Statutory Notice</strong> to all heirs and beneficiaries within 60 days of death. With Burbank home values in neighborhoods like the <strong>Rancho District</strong> and <strong>Burbank Hills</strong> often exceeding $1.1M, trustees must also file a <strong>Notice of Death of Real Property Owner</strong> with the LA County Assessor. Proper administration ensures your family avoids costly court proceedings at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a> while protecting the family home from massive property tax hikes under <strong>Proposition 19</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Settle Industry Assets: Entertainment Residuals & Royalties</h2>
                    <p>Burbank is the global hub for the entertainment industry. Many of our local clients are former employees of Disney, Warner Bros, or Universal, meaning their trusts often include <strong>residual income streams, creative royalties, and intellectual property</strong>.</p>

                    <p>As your <strong>Burbank trust settlement lawyer</strong>, we ensure these complex industry assets are correctly valued and allocated. Unlike a standard bank account, residuals require specialized accounting to distinguish between principal and income. We act as your legal guide to ensure you meet your fiduciary duties, preventing disputes with beneficiaries who may not understand the valuation of these long-term income streams.</p>

                    <div class="stats-bar">
                        <div><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">$1.1M+</strong><br>Burbank Median Price</div>

                    <h2>The Heggstad Rescue: When Assets are Left Out</h2>
                    <p>While trust administration is designed to stay out of the public eye, mistakes happen. If you discover that a loved one forgot to deed their home in <strong>Magnolia Park</strong> or <strong>Toluca Lake</strong> into the trust, you aren't necessarily forced into a full 18-month probate.</p>

                    <p>We specialize in <a href="/probate"><strong>Heggstad Petitions (Probate Code § 850)</strong></a> filed at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a> in downtown Los Angeles. This allows the court to retroactively "fund" the trust, saving your family over $40,000 in statutory fees.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 19 Defense for Rancho District Homeowners</h2>
                    <p>In 2025, the greatest risk for a Burbank trustee is the <strong>Proposition 19 property tax trap</strong>. If a child inherits a parent's home and does not move in as their primary residence within one year, the tax bill can jump from $4,000 to over $20,000 annually. We handle all filings with the <strong>Los Angeles County Assessor</strong> to ensure your family's low tax base is protected during the <a href="/trust-administration">trust administration process</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Protecting Yourself from Personal Liability</h2>
                    <p>Successor trustees in Burbank are often family members who do not realize they can be held <strong>personally liable</strong> for mistakes. If you distribute assets too early, fail to pay a valid creditor, or skip a formal accounting, beneficiaries can "surcharge" you—forcing you to pay damages out of your own pocket. We act as your legal shield, ensuring every step of the administration is documented and legally compliant.</p>
