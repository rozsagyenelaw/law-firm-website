                <h2 style="margin-top:0; color: var(--p-blue);">Why is a Living Trust mandatory for Encino homeowners?</h2>
                <p>In Encino, CA, where median home prices currently exceed <span class="gold-text">$2,120,000</span>, the <strong>California probate process</strong> is a massive financial liability. Without a <strong>Living Trust</strong>, an estate valued at $2.1M will trigger mandatory statutory fees of approximately $68,000 and force your heirs into a 16-month court backlog at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/vne" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Van Nuys Courthouse</a>. A trust ensures immediate private transfer of your assets, keeping your personal legacy out of the public record.</p>

                    <h2>Navigating the Van Nuys Courthouse: Northwest District</h2>
                    <p>If you pass away in Encino without an estate plan, your family must navigate the <strong>Los Angeles Superior Court - Northwest District</strong>. Probate and conservatorship matters for the 91316 and 91436 zip codes are primarily handled at the <strong>Van Nuys Courthouse East (6230 Sylmar Ave, Van Nuys, CA 91401)</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The probate system in Van Nuys is currently facing heavy caseloads, with 12 to 18-month timelines becoming standard. During this period, your home in <strong>Amestoy Estates</strong> or <strong>Royal Oaks</strong> cannot be sold or refinanced without court approval, often causing families to miss peak market opportunities. As your <strong>Encino probate lawyer</strong>, we move quickly to file <strong>Heggstad Petitions</strong> or Small Estate Affidavits to save your family months of litigation and stress.</p>

                    <div class="stats-bar">
                        <div><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">$2.1M</strong><br>Median Encino Value</div>
                        <div><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">$68,000+</strong><br>Probate Fees Saved</div>

                    <h2>High-Net-Worth Planning: Royal Oaks & Amestoy Estates</h2>
                    <p>Encino is home to some of the San Fernando Valley's most valuable real estate. Whether you own a gated estate south of the boulevard or a luxury residence in <strong>Royal Oaks</strong>, your property values likely exceed the federal estate tax exemption thresholds for many families. We specialize in <strong>Asset Protection Trusts</strong> and <strong>Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs)</strong> designed to move future appreciation out of your taxable estate.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 19 & Property Tax Defense</h2>
                    <p>Because many Encino properties have been held for decades, they carry an extremely low tax base. Under <strong>California Proposition 19</strong>, if your heirs inherit your primary residence and do not make it their own primary residence within 12 months, the property tax will jump to current market value. On a $2.1M home, this could mean an annual tax bill increasing from $4,000 to $25,000. Our attorney-drafted <a href="/living-trusts">Living Trusts</a> include specific flexibility for successor trustees to help preserve your tax base for the next generation.</p>

                    <h2>Strategies for Professionals & Business Owners</h2>
                    <p>The Encino Commons area is the "Wall Street of the Valley." We serve many local business owners, medical professionals, and executives. We understand that your estate includes more than just your home; it includes <strong>professional practices, commercial real estate, and sophisticated brokerage portfolios</strong>. We coordinate these assets into a seamless plan that ensures business continuity and protects your professional legacy from creditors and lawsuits.</p>
