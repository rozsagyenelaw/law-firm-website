                <p>In Woodland Hills, CA, the median sale price for a home currently averages <span class="gold-text">$1,225,000</span>. This value is nearly six times the <strong>2025 California probate threshold</strong> of $208,850. Without a <strong>Living Trust</strong>, your estate will be subject to mandatory probate at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a>, resulting in statutory fees of approximately $48,000 and a 16-month delay. Our attorney-drafted trusts provide immediate, private asset transfer, bypassing court intervention entirely.</p>

                    <h2>Protecting Woodland Hills Assets: Warner Center to Walnut Acres</h2>
                    <p>Woodland Hills serves as the economic engine of the West Valley. Whether you own a multi-million dollar estate in <strong>Walnut Acres</strong>, a modern residence in <strong>Carlton Terrace</strong>, or a commercial enterprise in the <strong>Warner Center</strong>, your property likely represents decades of hard work. A "basic will" is insufficient for these high-equity assets because it offers no protection against the 40% federal estate tax or the aggressive reassessment rules of <strong>California Proposition 19</strong>.</p>

                    <p>As your <strong>Woodland Hills estate lawyer</strong>, we specialize in high-precision legal drafting. We ensure your <strong>Warner Center condos</strong> and <strong>hillside properties</strong> are correctly titled in your trust, preventing the "unfunded trust" mistake that forces thousands of families into probate every year. We also provide specialized <strong>Business Succession Planning</strong> for local entrepreneurs to ensure their companies continue to thrive if the owner becomes incapacitated.</p>

                    <div class="stats-bar">
                        <div><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">$1.2M+</strong><br>Median WH Value</div>
                        <div><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">$48,000+</strong><br>Mandatory Fees Saved</div>
                        <div><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">$208,850</strong><br>2025 Threshold</div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Navigating the Stanley Mosk Courthouse Backlog</h2>
                    <p>While Woodland Hills is in the West Valley, all formal probate administration is centralized at the <strong>Stanley Mosk Courthouse (111 N. Hill St, Los Angeles, CA 90012)</strong>. The current backlog in LA County means even simple petitions can take 12 to 24 months to resolve. During this window, your home in <strong>91364 or 91367</strong> cannot be sold to cover debts or inheritance without a court order.</p>

                    <p>We help families utilize <strong>Heggstad Petitions (Probate Code § 850)</strong> to "rescue" properties that were accidentally left out of a trust. This specialized maneuver can often move a Woodland Hills home back into a trust without the full 18-month probate process, saving heirs thousands in court costs and months of frustration.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 19 & Property Tax Defense</h2>
                    <p>Woodland Hills real estate has seen significant appreciation, especially south of the boulevard. Under <strong>California Proposition 19</strong>, if your heirs inherit your primary residence and do not make it their own primary residence within 12 months, the annual tax bill could jump from $5,000 to $18,000 or more. Our <a href="/living-trusts">Living Trust packages</a> include flexible distribution language designed to help preserve your low tax base for your children whenever legally possible.</p>

                    <h2>Incapacity Planning for Professionals</h2>
                    <p>Beyond death planning, a comprehensive estate plan includes <strong>Durable Power of Attorney</strong> and <strong>Advance Healthcare Directives</strong>. This is critical for Woodland Hills professionals who manage high-value investments or businesses. If you become incapacitated due to illness or injury without these documents, your family would be forced to file for a public and expensive <strong>Court Conservatorship</strong>. A trust-based plan ensures your hand-picked successor steps in immediately with zero court involvement.</p>

                    <p>Our comprehensive estate planning packages include:</p>
