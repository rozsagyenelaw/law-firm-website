However, if you die with assets outside the trust (like a bank account that wasn't transferred), those assets may require probate. This is why proper trust funding is critical. Assets that avoid probate when held in trust include: real estate, bank accounts, investment accounts, business interests, and personal property. Our Glendale trust attorney ensures your trust is properly funded to completely avoid probate."

                        <p>While a will is better than nothing, a living trust offers significant advantages in California.
