                <p>Trust administration in Glendale begins with serving the <strong>16061.7 Notice</strong> to all heirs within 60 days and filing a <strong>Notice of Death of Real Property Owner</strong> with the Los Angeles County Assessor. Because median home values in Glendale neighborhoods like <strong>Rossmoyne</strong> exceed $1.2M, trustees must carefully manage the <strong>Proposition 19</strong> exclusion within one year of death to avoid permanent property tax increases for the beneficiaries.</p>

                    <h2>Administering Historic Assets in Rossmoyne & Verdugo Woodlands</h2>
                    <p>Glendale is home to some of the most beautiful historic real estate in the San Fernando Valley. Whether the trust property is a Spanish Colonial in <strong>Rossmoyne</strong> or a mid-century estate in <strong>Glenoaks Canyon</strong>, the "Step-up in Basis" at the time of death is a critical tax advantage. We coordinate with local Glendale appraisers to ensure the <strong>Date of Death Value</strong> is documented correctly, potentially saving heirs hundreds of thousands in future capital gains taxes.</p>

                    <p>As your <strong>Glendale trust settlement lawyer</strong>, we provide the technical precision required by the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a> and the Los Angeles County Probate Division. While trust administration is designed to be a private process, any administrative errors can trigger a lawsuit that forces the trust into a public and expensive court battle.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 19: The Property Tax Threat for Glendale Heirs</h2>
                    <p>If you are administering a trust that includes a primary residence in Glendale, you are on a strict clock. Under <strong>California Proposition 19</strong>, if the children do not move into the parent's home as their primary residence within 12 months, the property tax will be reassessed to market value. On a $1.2M Glendale home, this could mean annual taxes jumping from $3,000 to $15,000 permanently. We specialize in "Prop 19 Defense," ensuring all filings with the <strong>LA County Assessor</strong> are completed accurately to protect the family legacy.</p>

                    <h2>Trustee Personal Liability Protection</h2>
                    <p>Successor trustees in Glendale are often family members who do not realize they can be held <strong>personally liable</strong> for mistakes. Common errors like distributing assets too early, missing the Medi-Cal (DHCS) notification deadline, or failing to provide a formal accounting can lead to surcharges. Our firm acts as your legal shield, ensuring every step of the <a href="/trust-administration">trust administration process</a> is handled with 100% legal compliance.</p>

                    <h2>The Heggstad Rescue: When Assets are Left Out</h2>
                    <p>Did you find a Glendale property that was never formally transferred into the trust? Before you file for a full 18-month probate, let us evaluate if we can file a <a href="/probate"><strong>Heggstad Petition (Probate Code § 850)</strong></a>. We have successfully rescued millions in Glendale real estate by asking the court to retroactively "fund" the trust, saving heirs significant time and money. These petitions are filed at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a> in downtown Los Angeles.</p>

                    <h2>Critical Trustee Deadlines for Glendale Estates</h2>
                    <p>Missing these statutory deadlines can expose you to personal liability:</p>
