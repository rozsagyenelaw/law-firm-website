                <p>Settling a trust in Calabasas (91302/91372) requires immediate adherence to California's fiduciary laws: serving the <strong>16061.7 Statutory Notice</strong> to all heirs within 60 days and documenting a "Step-up in Basis" appraisal for high-equity real estate. With median home values in <strong>The Oaks</strong> and <strong>Hidden Hills</strong> often exceeding $3M, successor trustees must file intergenerational exclusions with the LA County Assessor within one year to protect the <strong>Proposition 19</strong> tax base. All formal judicial petitions for Calabasas residents are centralized at the <a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Managing High-Value Assets in The Oaks & Mountain View Estates</h2>
                    <p>Trust administration in Calabasas typically involves more than just residential property. We assist successor trustees in managing complex portfolios that include <strong>private equity interests, commercial holdings, and high-value personal property</strong>. Because the federal estate tax exemption (currently $13.99 million per person) is a frequent concern for Calabasas families, we provide the technical oversight needed to ensure a tax-efficient distribution that respects the settlor's legacy.</p>

                    <p>As your <strong>Calabasas trust settlement lawyer</strong>, we provide the formal <strong>Trustee Accounting</strong> required to shield you from personal liability. In an area with many sophisticated and high-profile beneficiaries, providing a transparent, attorney-verified accounting is your strongest defense against claims of mismanagement or breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

                    <h2>Stanley Mosk Courthouse: Centralized Hub for 91302 Filings</h2>
                    <p>While the goal of trust administration is to remain a private process, judicial instruction is sometimes necessary. If a Calabasas property was accidentally left out of the trust, we can file a <a href="/probate"><strong>Heggstad Petition (Probate Code § 850)</strong></a>. Following the latest 2025 LA County court rules, all such probate and trust administration petitions for Calabasas residents are centralized at the <strong><a href="https://www.lacourt.ca.gov/courthouse/info/address/smn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley Mosk Courthouse</a> (111 N. Hill St, Los Angeles)</strong>. We manage the entire downtown filing process, saving you the burden of navigating the central probate division alone.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 19 Defense for Calabasas Gated Communities</h2>
                    <p>In 2025, the <strong>Proposition 19</strong> intergenerational transfer exclusion is a critical focus for Calabasas trustees. For transfers occurring between February 2025 and 2027, the exclusion amount is capped at <strong>$1,044,586</strong> above the original tax base. If a successor trustee fails to coordinate the child's residency requirement and the Assessor's filings within one year, a luxury estate in <strong>Calabasas Park</strong> could face a property tax reassessment jumping from $10,000 to over $40,000 annually. We handle these filings meticulously to protect your family's generational wealth.</p>

                    <h2>Protecting Yourself from Fiduciary Surcharges</h2>
                    <p>Successor trustees in Calabasas are often held to the "Prudent Investor" standard. If you distribute assets too early, miss the Medi-Cal notification window, or fail to provide a final trust accounting, beneficiaries can petition the court to "surcharge" you—making you personally liable for damages. Our firm acts as your legal shield, documenting every fiduciary step of the <a href="/trust-administration">trust administration process</a> to protect your personal assets.</p>
